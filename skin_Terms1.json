        "article": "Botulinum toxin or botulinum neurotoxin (commonly called botox) is a highly potent neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction thus causing flaccid paralysis. The toxin causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially for medical and cosmetic purposes. Botulinum toxin is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and a neuromuscular blocking agent.The seven main types of botulinum toxin are named types A to G (A B C1 C2 D E F and G). New types are occasionally found. Types A and B are capable of causing disease in humans and are also used commercially and medically. Types C\u2013G are less common; types E and F can cause disease in humans while the other types cause disease in other animals.Botulinum toxins are among the most potent toxins known to science. Intoxication can occur naturally as a result of either wound or intestinal infection or by ingesting formed toxin in food. The estimated human median lethal dose of type A toxin is 1.3\u20132.1\u00a0ng/kg intravenously or intramuscularly 10\u201313\u00a0ng/kg when inhaled or 1000\u00a0ng/kg when taken by mouth."

        "article": "Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness blurred vision feeling tired and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms chest muscles and legs. Vomiting swelling of the abdomen and diarrhea may also occur. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.Botulism can occur in several ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water and are very resistant. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism instead happens when the bacterium develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than one year old as protective mechanisms against development of the bacterium develop after that age. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation spores enter a wound and in the absence of oxygen release the toxin. The disease is not passed directly between people. Its diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question.Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin though not the spores are destroyed by heating it to more than 85\u00a0\u00b0C (185\u00a0\u00b0F) for longer than five minutes. The clostridial spores can be destroyed in the autoclave with moist heat (120\u00b0C/ 250\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes) or dry heat (160\u00b0C for 2 hours) or by irradiation. The spores of group I strains are inactivated by heating at 121\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) for 3 minutes during commercial canning. Spores of group II strains are less heat-resistant and they are often damaged by 90\u00b0C (194\u00b0F) for 10 minutes 85\u00b0C for 52 minutes or 80\u00b0C for 270 minutes; however these treatments may not be sufficient in some foods. Honey can contain the organism and for this reason honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism also affects many other animals. The word is from Latin botulus meaning 'sausage'."

People suffering from it present difficulties in the professional field more than 80% experiencing a moderate to severe emotional impact from the disease and half are subject to depression.This excess of sweat happens even if the person is not engaging in tasks that require muscular effort and it does not depend on the exposure to heat. Common places to sweat can include underarms face neck back groin feet and hands. It has been called by some researchers 'the silent handicap'.Both diaphoresis and hidrosis can mean either perspiration (in which sense they are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration in which case they refer to a specific narrowly defined clinical disorder."

        "article": "Intramuscular injection often abbreviated IM is the injection of a substance into a muscle. In medicine it is one of several methods for parenteral administration of medications. Intramuscular injection may be preferred because muscles have larger and more numerous blood vessels than subcutaneous tissue leading to faster absorption than subcutaneous or intradermal injections. Medication administered via intramuscular injection is not subject to the first-pass metabolism effect which affects oral medications.Common sites for intramuscular injections include the deltoid muscle of the upper arm and the gluteal muscle of the buttock. In infants the vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh is commonly used. The injection site must be cleaned before administering the injection and the injection is then administered in a fast darting motion to decrease the discomfort to the individual. The volume to be injected in the muscle is usually limited to 2\u20135 milliliters depending on injection site. A site with signs of infection or muscle atrophy should not be chosen. Intramuscular injections should not be used in people with myopathies or those with trouble clotting.Intramuscular injections commonly result in pain redness and swelling or inflammation around the injection site. These side effects are generally mild and last no more than a few days at most. Rarely nerves or blood vessels around the injection site can be damaged resulting in severe pain or paralysis. If proper technique is not followed intramuscular injections can result in localized infections such as abscesses and gangrene. While historically aspiration or pulling back on the syringe before injection was recommended to prevent inadvertent administration into a vein it is no longer recommended for most injection sites by some countries."

Complications may adversely affect the prognosis or outcome of a disease. Complications generally involve a worsening in the severity of the disease or the development of new signs symptoms or pathological changes that may become widespread throughout the body and affect other organ systems. Thus complications may lead to the development of new diseases resulting from previously existing diseases. Complications may also arise as a result of various treatments.The development of complications depends on a number of factors including the degree of vulnerability susceptibility age health status and immune system condition. Knowledge of the most common and severe complications of a disease procedure or treatment allows for prevention and preparation for treatment if they should occur.Complications are not to be confused with sequelae which are residual effects that occur after the acute (initial most severe) phase of an illness or injury. Sequelae can appear early in the development of disease or weeks to months later and are a result of the initial injury or illness. For example a scar resulting from a burn or dysphagia resulting from a stroke would be considered sequelae. In addition complications should not be confused with comorbidities which are diseases that occur concurrently but have no causative association. Complications are similar to adverse effects but the latter term is typically used in pharmacological contexts or when the negative consequence is expected or common."

The symptoms of the HAIR-AN syndrome are largely due to severe insulin resistance which can be secondary to blocking antibodies against the insulin receptor or genetically absent/reduced insulin receptor number/function. Insulin resistance leads to hyperinsulinemia which in turn leads to an excess production of androgen hormones by the ovaries. High levels of androgen hormones (hyperandrogenism) in females causes excessive hair growth acne and irregular menstruation. Patients with both underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance may have more severe hyperandrogenism. Insulin resistance is also associated with diabetes heart disease and excessive darkening of the skin (acanthosis nigricans)"

        "article": "Many skin conditions affect the human integumentary system\u2014the organ system covering the entire surface of the body and composed of skin hair nails and related muscle and glands. The major function of this system is as a barrier against the external environment. The skin weighs an average of four kilograms covers an area of two square metres and is made of three distinct layers: the epidermis dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The two main types of human skin are: glabrous skin the hairless skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the \"palmoplantar\" surfaces) and hair-bearing skin. Within the latter type the hairs occur in structures called pilosebaceous units each with hair follicle sebaceous gland and associated arrector pili muscle. In the embryo the epidermis hair and glands form from the ectoderm which is chemically influenced by the underlying mesoderm that forms the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.The epidermis is the most superficial layer of skin a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum stratum lucidum stratum granulosum stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Nourishment is provided to these layers by diffusion from the dermis since the epidermis is without direct blood supply.  The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes melanocytes Langerhans cells and Merkel cells. Of these keratinocytes are the major component constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum where cells are continually shed from the surface. In normal skin the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer to the top of the granular cell layer and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.The dermis is the layer of skin between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue and comprises two sections the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis. The superficial papillary dermis interdigitates with the overlying rete ridges of the epidermis between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone. Structural components of the dermis are collagen elastic fibers and ground substance. Within these components are the pilosebaceous units arrector pili muscles and the eccrine and apocrine glands. The dermis contains two vascular networks that run parallel to the skin surface\u2014one superficial and one deep plexus\u2014which are connected by vertical communicating vessels. The function of blood vessels within the dermis is fourfold: to supply nutrition to regulate temperature to modulate inflammation and to participate in wound healing.The subcutaneous tissue is a layer of fat between the dermis and underlying fascia. This tissue may be further divided into two components the actual fatty layer or panniculus adiposus and a deeper vestigial layer of muscle the panniculus carnosus. The main cellular component of this tissue is the adipocyte or fat cell. The structure of this tissue is composed of septal (i.e. linear strands) and lobular compartments which differ in microscopic appearance. Functionally the subcutaneous fat insulates the body absorbs trauma and serves as a reserve energy source.Conditions of the human integumentary system constitute a broad spectrum of diseases also known as dermatoses as well as many nonpathologic states (like in certain circumstances melanonychia and racquet nails). While only a small number of skin diseases account for most visits to the physician thousands of skin conditions have been described. Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges since underlying etiologies and pathogenetics are often not known. Therefore most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example conditions of the mucous membrane) morphology (chronic blistering conditions) etiology (skin conditions resulting from physical factors) and so on. Clinically the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering pertinent information regarding the presenting skin lesion(s) including the location (such as arms head legs) symptoms (pruritus pain) duration (acute or chronic) arrangement (solitary generalized annular linear) morphology (macules papules vesicles) and color (red blue brown black white yellow). Diagnosis of many conditions often also requires a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data."

This disorder is one that affects bone growth and is characterized by skeletal brain and skin abnormalities. Those affected by the disorder are severely short in height and commonly possess shorter arms and legs. In addition the bones of the legs are often bowed and the affected have smaller chests with shorter rib bones along with curved collarbones. Other symptoms of the disorder include broad fingers and extra folds of skin on the arms and legs. Developmentally many individuals who suffer from the disorder show a higher level in delays and disability. Seizures are also common due to structural abnormalities of the brain. Those affected may also suffer with apnea the slowing or loss of breath for short periods of time.Many of the features of SADDAN are similar to those seen in other skeletal disorders specifically achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.Achondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. This type of dwarfism is caused by the inability of the cartilage of the skeleton to ossify and turn to bone. Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition in which areas of the skin is of a dark and velvety discoloration often seen in the body folds and creases such as the armpits groin and neck. Within those affected by SADDAN acanthosis nigricans develops early on usually in infancy or early childhood."

Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads pimples oily skin and possible scarring. It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands including the face upper part of the chest and back. The resulting appearance can lead to lack of confidence anxiety reduced self-esteem and in extreme cases depression or thoughts of suicide.Susceptibility to acne is primarily genetic in 80% of cases. The roles of diet and cigarette smoking in the condition are unclear and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. In both sexes hormones called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism by causing increased production of sebum. Another common factor is the excessive growth of the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes which is present on the skin.Treatments for acne are available including lifestyle changes medications and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may minimize the condition. Treatments applied directly to the affected skin such as azelaic acid benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne. However resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help prevent acne in women. Medical professionals typically reserve isotretinoin pills for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact on individuals.In 2015 acne affected approximately 633\u00a0million people globally making it the eighth-most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80\u201390% of teenagers in the Western world. Some rural societies report lower rates of acne than industrialized ones. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty. Although acne becomes less common in adulthood it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continues to have difficulties in their forties."

Its genome has been sequenced and a study has shown several genes can generate enzymes for degrading skin and proteins that may be immunogenic (activating the immune system).The species is largely commensal and part of the skin flora present on most healthy adult humans' skin.  It is usually just barely detectable on the skin of healthy preadolescents.  It lives among other things primarily on fatty acids in sebum secreted by sebaceous glands in the follicles. It may also be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract.Originally identified as Bacillus acnes it was later named Propionibacterium acnes for its ability to generate propionic acid. In 2016 P. acnes was taxonomically reclassified as a result of biochemical and genomic studies. In terms of both phylogenetic tree structure and DNA G + C content the cutaneous species was distinguishable from other species that had been previously categorized as P. acnes.  As part of restructuring the novel genus Cutibacterium was created for the cutaneous species including those formerly identified as Propionibacterium acnes Propionibacterium avidum and Propionibacterium granulosum. Characterization of phylotypes of C. acnes is an active field of research."

In many cases symptoms are mild and the disease does not require treatment. Mild cases will resemble dirt on the cat's chin but the \"dirt\" will not brush off. More severe cases however may respond slowly to treatment and seriously detract from the health and appearance of the cat. Feline acne can affect cats of any age sex or breed although Persian cats are also likely to develop acne on the face and in the skin folds. This problem can happen once be reoccurring or even  persistent throughout the cat's life.Sebaceous glands are skin glands that produce oil and are mostly found in the skin of the chin at the base of the tail and in the eyelids lips prepuce and scrotum. They are connected to hair follicles. In acne the follicles become clogged with black sebaceous material forming comedones (also known as blackheads). Comedones can become irritated swollen infected and ultimately pustules. These may elicit itching and discomfort due to swelling and bacterial growth inside infected glands. Bacterial folliculitis occurs when follicules become infected with Staphylococcus aureus and commonly associated  with moderate-to-severe feline acne. Secondary fungal infections by Malassezia may also occur.Other conditions that can cause similar-appearing conditions include skin mites ringworm yeast infection or autoimmune diseases such as eosinophilic granuloma complex (\"rodent ulcers\"). These can be ruled out by a simple biopsy of affected cells.Feline acne is one of the top five most common skin conditions that veterinarians treat."

These are typically painful and break open releasing fluid or pus. The areas most commonly affected are the underarms under the breasts perineum buttocks and the groin. Scar tissue remains after healing. HS may significantly limit many everyday activities for instance walking hugging moving and sitting down. Sitting disability may occur in patients with lesions in sacral gluteal perineal femoral groin or genital regions; and prolonged periods of sitting down can also worsen the condition of the skin of these patients.The exact cause is usually unclear but believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. About a third of people with the disease have an affected family member. Other risk factors include obesity and smoking. The condition is not caused by an infection poor hygiene or the use of deodorant. Instead it is believed to be caused by hair follicles being obstructed with the nearby apocrine sweat glands being strongly implicated in this obstruction. The sweat glands themselves may or may not be inflamed. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms.No cure is knownthough surgical excision with wet-to-dry dressings proper wound care and  warm baths or showering with a pulse-jet shower may be used in those with mild disease. Cutting open the lesions to allow them to drain does not result in significant benefit. While antibiotics are commonly used evidence for their use is poor. Immunosuppressive medication may also be tried. In those with more severe disease laser therapy or surgery to remove the affected skin may be viable. Rarely a skin lesion may develop into skin cancer.If mild cases of HS are included then the estimate of its frequency is from 1\u20134% of the population. Women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with it than men. Onset is typically in young adulthood and may become less common after 50 years old. It was first described between 1833 and 1839 by French anatomist Alfred Velpeau."

AKN is characterized by firm pink flesh-colored or hyperpigmented bumps in the skin which are usually located on the back of the head or neck. This is mainly because men often cut their hair very low as opposed to women allowing the hair to prick the occipital scalp thereby causing irritation. Acne keloidalis nuchae most commonly presents itself in individuals aged 13 to 25. The disease is closely related to pseudofolliculitis barbae and both occur frequently in black men in the military where it is so common that the US Army has developed official protocols for management. Prolonged cases of AKN can cause keloid formation due to chronic irritation from folliculitis. Bacterial folliculitis and acne can mimic the appearance of AKN; however unlike acne comedones are not seen with AKN.Treatments for AKN aim to reduce inflammation and prevent infections and scarring. Therapies for AKN may include topical antibiotics topical or intralesional corticosteroids and laser hair removal. Recommended modifications to shaving habits include liberal use of shaving cream avoidance of stretching the skin while shaving and use of a single-blade razor rather than a razor with multiple blades."

This photo induced skin reaction leads to a mono-morphous eruption that consists of multiple uniform red papular lesions. This skin reaction is classified as a delayed-type hypersensitivity because the onset is 24\u201372 hours after sun exposure. The condition equally affects men and women between the ages of 20\u201340 years old with no prior history of acne vulgaris. The eruption is unusual because it spares the face but it affects the lateral aspects of the upper arms shoulder girdle back and chest.

It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue (collagen type III) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type I.  Keloids are firm rubbery lesions or shiny fibrous nodules and can vary from pink to the color of the person's skin or red to dark brown in color. A keloid scar is benign and not contagious but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness pain and changes in texture. In severe cases it can affect movement of skin. In the United States keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of sub-Saharan African descent than in people of European descent. There is a higher tendency to develop a keloid among those with a family history of keloids and people between the ages of 10 and 30 years.Keloids should not be confused with hypertrophic scars which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound."

        "article": "A scar (or scar tissue) is an area of fibrous tissue that replaces normal skin after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of wound repair in the skin as well as in other organs and tissues of the body. Thus scarring is a natural part of the healing process. With the exception of very minor lesions every wound (e.g. after accident disease or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete regeneration which regrow tissue without scar formation.Scar tissue is composed of the same protein (collagen) as the tissue that it replaces but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction. This collagen scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen randomised alignment. For example scars in the skin are less resistant to ultraviolet radiation and sweat glands and hair follicles do not grow back within scar tissues. A myocardial infarction commonly known as a heart attack  causes scar formation in the heart muscle which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly heart failure. However there are some tissues (e.g. bone) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration."

For example a part of the human microbiota such as the skin flora gut flora or vaginal flora can become deranged with normally dominating species underrepresented and normally outcompeted or contained species increasing to fill the void. Similar to the human gut microbiome diverse microbes colonize the plant rhizosphere and dysbiosis in the rhizosphere can negatively impact plant health. Dysbiosis is most commonly reported as a condition in the gastrointestinal tract or plant rhizosphere.Typical microbial colonies found on or in the body are benign or beneficial. These appropriately sized microbial colonies carry out a series of helpful and necessary functions such as aiding in digestion.  They also help protect the body from infiltration by pathogenic microbes. These beneficial microbial colonies compete with each other for space and resources. However when this balance is disturbed these colonies exhibit a decreased ability to check each other's growth which can then lead to overgrowth of one or more of the disturbed colonies which may further damage some of the other smaller beneficial ones in a vicious cycle. As more beneficial colonies are damaged making the imbalance more pronounced more overgrowth issues occur because the damaged colonies are less able to check the growth of the overgrowing ones.  If this goes unchecked long enough a pervasive and chronic imbalance between colonies will set in which ultimately minimizes the beneficial nature of these colonies as a whole."

In the majority of cases the individual ulcers last about 7\u201310 days and ulceration episodes occur 3\u20136 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth \u2013 i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue \u2013 although the more severe forms which are less common may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.The condition is very common affecting about 20% of the general population to some degree. The onset is often during childhood or adolescence and the condition usually lasts for several years before gradually disappearing. There is no cure but treatments such as corticosteroids aim to manage pain reduce healing time and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration."

It can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer renal and pulmonary cysts and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas are the most common manifestation found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%) and 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors both cancerous and benign occur in 14\u201334% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.Any of these conditions that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt\u2013Hogg\u2013Dub\u00e9 syndrome though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood it appears to be a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals including fruit flies German Shepherds rats and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977 but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002 after kidney cancer collapsed lungs and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.Birt\u2013Hogg\u2013Dub\u00e9 syndrome can manifest similarly to other diseases which must be ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas and Von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed people with BHD are treated preventatively with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care. Dermatologic examinations neck ultrasounds and colonoscopies should be considered as well [1]."

        "article": "Leprosy also known as Hansen's disease (HD) is a long-term infection by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Infection can lead to damage of the nerves respiratory tract skin and eyes. This nerve damage may result in a lack of ability to feel pain which can lead to the loss of parts of a person's extremities from repeated injuries or infection through unnoticed wounds. An infected person may also experience muscle weakness and poor eyesight. Leprosy symptoms may begin within one year but for some people symptoms may take 20 years or more to occur.Leprosy is spread between people although extensive contact is necessary. Leprosy has a low pathogenicity and 95% of people who contract M. leprae do not develop the disease. Spread is thought to occur through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of a person infected by leprosy. Genetic factors and immune function play a role in how easily a person catches the disease. Leprosy does not spread during pregnancy to the unborn child or through sexual contact. Leprosy occurs more commonly among people living in poverty. There are two main types of the disease \u2013 paucibacillary and multibacillary which differ in the number of bacteria present. A person with paucibacillary disease has five or fewer poorly pigmented numb skin patches while a person with multibacillary disease has more than five skin patches. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy of the skin.Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy. Treatment of paucibacillary leprosy is with the medications dapsone rifampicin and clofazimine for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy uses the same medications for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization.Leprosy is not highly contagious. People with leprosy can live with their families and go to school and work. In the 1980s there were 5.2\u00a0million cases globally but by 2020 this decreased to fewer than 200000. Most new cases occur in 14 countries with India accounting for more than half. In the 20 years from 1994 to 2014 16\u00a0million people worldwide were cured of leprosy. About 200 cases per year are reported in the United States. Central Florida accounted for 81% of cases in Florida and nearly 1 out of 5 leprosy cases nationwide. Separating people affected by leprosy by placing them in leper colonies still occurs in some areas of India China Africa and Thailand.Leprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Greek word \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1 (l\u00e9pra) from \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2 (lep\u00eds; 'scale') while the term \"Hansen's disease\" is named after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen. Leprosy has historically been associated with social stigma which continues to be a barrier to self-reporting and early treatment. Some consider the word leper offensive preferring the phrase \"person affected with leprosy\". Leprosy is classified as a neglected tropical disease. World Leprosy Day was started in 1954 to draw awareness to those affected by leprosy."

They may become itchy or sore and occur singularly or in groups. Any area of the skin may be affected with abdomen legs arms neck genital area and face being the most common. Onset of the lesions is around seven weeks after infection. They usually go away within a year without scarring.The infection is caused by a poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). The virus is spread either by direct contact including sexual activity or via contaminated objects such as towels. The condition can also be spread to other areas of the body by the person themselves. Risk factors include a weak immune system atopic dermatitis and crowded living conditions. Following one infection it is possible to get re-infected. Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance of the lesions.Prevention includes hand washing and not sharing personal items. While treatment is not necessary some may wish to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons or to prevent spread. Removal may occur with freezing laser therapy or opening up the lesion and scraping the inside. Scraping the lesion can however result in scarring. The oral medication cimetidine or podophyllotoxin cream applied to the skin may also be used for treatment.Approximately 122\u00a0million people globally were affected by molluscum contagiosum as of 2010 (1.8% of the population). It is more common in children between the ages of one and ten years old. The condition has become more common in the United States since 1966. But having an infection is not a reason to keep a child out of school or daycare."

        "article": "Actinic keratosis (AK) sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis is a pre-cancerous area of thick scaly or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-). These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature if left untreated they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended.Actinic keratoses characteristically appear as thick scaly or crusty areas that often feel dry or rough. Size commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters but they can grow to be several centimeters in diameter.  Notably AKs are often felt before they are seen and the texture is sometimes compared to sandpaper. They may be dark light tan pink red a combination of all these or have the same color as the surrounding skin.Given the causal relationship between sun exposure and AK growth they often appear on a background of sun-damaged skin and in areas that are commonly sun-exposed such as the face ears neck scalp chest backs of hands forearms or lips.  Because sun exposure is rarely limited to a small area most people who have an AK have more than one.If clinical examination findings are not typical of AK and the possibility of in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cannot be excluded based on clinical examination alone a biopsy or excision can be considered for definitive diagnosis by histologic examination of the lesional tissue. Multiple treatment options for AK are available. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one option for the treatment of numerous AK lesions in a region of the skin termed field cancerization. It involves the application of a photosensitizer to the skin followed by illumination with a strong light source. Topical creams such as 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod may require daily application to affected skin areas over a typical time course of weeks.Cryotherapy is frequently used for few and well-defined lesions but undesired skin lightening or hypopigmentation may occur at the treatment site. By following up with a dermatologist AKs can be treated before they progress to skin cancer. If cancer does develop from an AK lesion it can be caught early with close monitoring at a time when treatment is likely to have a high cure rate."

The adapalene molecule is more stable compared to tretinoin and tazarotene which leads to less concern for photodegradation. It is also chemically more stable compared to the other two retinoids allowing it to be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide. Due to its effects on keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation adapalene is superior to tretinoin for the treatment of comedonal acne and is often used as a first-line agent.

        "article": "Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC) also known as squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous-cell skin cancer is one of the three principal types of skin cancer alongside basal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. cSCC typically presents as a hard lump with a scaly surface though it may also present as an ulcer. Onset and development often occurs over several months. Compared to basal cell carcinoma cSCC  is more likely to spread to distant areas. When confined to the epidermis the outermost layer of the skin the pre-invasive or in situ form of cSCC is termed Bowen's disease.The most significant risk factor for cSCC is extensive lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. Additional risk factors include prior scars chronic wounds actinic keratosis lighter skin susceptible to sunburn Bowen's disease exposure to arsenic radiation therapy tobacco smoking poor immune system function previous basal cell carcinoma and HPV infection. The risk associated with UV radiation correlates with cumulative exposure rather than early-life exposure. Tanning beds have emerged as a significant source of UV radiation. Genetic predispositions such as xeroderma pigmentosum and certain forms of epidermolysis bullosa also increase susceptibility to cSCC. The condition originates from squamous cells located in the skin's upper layers. Diagnosis typically relies on skin examination and is confirmed through skin biopsy.Research both in vivo and in vitro indicates a crucial role for the upregulation of FGFR2 part of the fibroblast growth factor receptor immunoglobin family in cSCC cell progression. Mutations in the TPL2 gene leads to overexpression of FGFR2 which activates the mTORC1 and AKT pathways in primary and metastatic cSCC cell lines. Utilization of a \"pan FGFR inhibitor\" has shown to reduce cell migration and proliferation in cSCC in vitro studies.Preventive measures against cSCC include minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen. Surgical removal is the typical treatment method employing simple excision for minor cases or Mohs surgery for more extensive instances. Other options include cryotherapy and radiation therapy. For cases with distant metastasis chemotherapy or biologic therapy may be employed.As of 2015 approximately 2.2 million individuals globally were living with cSCC at any given time constituting about 20% of all skin cancer cases. In the United States approximately 12% of males and 7% of females are diagnosed with cSCC at some point in their lives. While prognosis remains favorable in the absence of metastasis upon distant spread the five-year survival rate is markedly reduced to ~34%. In 2015 global deaths attributed to cSCC numbered around 52000. The average age at diagnosis is approximately 66 years. Following successful treatment of an initial cSCC lesion there is a substantial risk of developing subsequent lesions.As of 2015 about 2.2 million people worldwide have cSCC at any given time. About 20% of all skin cancer cases consist of cSCC. About 12% of males and 7% of females in the United States develop cSCC at some point in time. While prognosis is usually good when distant spread occurs five-year survival is ~34%. In 2015 cSCC resulted in approximately 52000 deaths globally. The mean age at diagnosis is around 66 years. Following the successful treatment of one case of cSCC a person is at significant risk of developing further cSCC lesions."

        "article": "In medicine a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin. Most drug-induced cutaneous reactions are mild and disappear when the offending drug is withdrawn. These are called \"simple\" drug eruptions. However more serious drug eruptions may be associated with organ injury such as liver or kidney damage and are categorized as \"complex\". Drugs can also cause hair and nail changes affect the mucous membranes or cause itching without outward skin changes.The use of synthetic pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals in medicine has revolutionized human health allowing us to live longer lives. Consequently the average human adult is exposed to many drugs over longer treatment periods throughout a lifetime. This unprecedented rise in pharmaceutical use has led to an increasing number of observed adverse drug reactions.There are two broad categories of adverse drug reactions. Type A reactions are known side effects of a drug that are largely predictable and are called pharmatoxicologic. Whereas Type B or hypersensitivity reactions are often immune-mediated and reproducible with repeated exposure to normal dosages of a given drug. Unlike type A reactions the mechanism of type B or hypersensitivity drug reactions is not fully elucidated. However there is a complex interplay between a patient's inherited genetics the pharmacotoxicology of the drug and the immune response that ultimately give rise to the manifestation of a drug eruption.Because the manifestation of a drug eruption is complex and highly individual there are many subfields in medicine that are studying this phenomenon. For example the field of pharmacogenomics aims to prevent the occurrence of severe adverse drug reactions by analyzing a person's inherited genetic risk. As such there are clinical examples of inherited genetic alleles that are known to predict drug hypersensitivities and for which diagnostic testing is available."

These eruptions are pustules i.e. small red white or red elevations of the skin that contain cloudy or purulent material (pus). The skin lesions usually resolve within 1\u20133 days of stopping the offending medication. However more severe cases are associated with a more persistent disorder that may be complicated by secondary skin infections and/or involvement of the liver lung and/or kidney.Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) disorders are regarded as the drug-induced activation of T cells which then initiate innate immune responses that are inappropriately directed against self tissues. Studies on the DRESS syndrome Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and SJS/TEN overlap indicate that many individuals are predisposed to develop these reactions to a particular medication based on their genetically determined expression of particular human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) alleles or T-cell receptors and/or their efficiencies in adsorbing distributing to tissues metabolizing and/or eliminating) a particular SCARS-inducing medication.

Angiofibromas are benign papule nodule and/or tumor lesions that are separated into various subtypes based primarily on the characteristic locations of their lesions. KTs are angiofibromas that develop in and under the toenails and/or fingernails. KTs were once considered as the same as another subtype of the angiofibromas viz. acral angiofibromas. While the literature may still sometimes regard KTs as acral angiofibromas acral angiofibromas are characteristically located in areas close to but not in the toenails and fingernails as well as in the soles of the feet and palms of the hands. KTs are here regarded as distinct from acral angiofibromas.KTs most commonly develop in individuals who have the rare genetic disease tuberous sclerosis (a heritable neurocutaneous disorder) and uncommonly in individuals that do not have this genetic disease. One individual with another rare genetic disease that has similarities to tuberous sclerosis the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome has also been reported to have typical KT findings.KTs are strictly benign (i.e. do not metastasize) but may be painful disfiguring and sometimes large and/or incapacitating lesions. They have often been treated by strictly local surgical resections. However they do have a high rate of recurrence at the site of resection and therefore have been treated with various other non-invasive local measures in efforts to avoid recurrences; these other methods have also been preferred to treat numerous tumors in individuals for cosmetic reasons and/or to relieve tumor-induce incapacitations."

TSC is a rare multi-system genetic disease that can cause benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys heart eyes lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures developmental delay behavioural problems and skin abnormalities as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes TSC1 and TSC2 which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.The history of TSC research is commonly divided into four periods. In the late 19th century notable physicians working in European teaching hospitals first described the cortical and dermatological manifestations; these early researchers have been awarded with eponyms such as \"Bourneville's disease\" and \"Pringle's adenoma sebaceum\". At the start of the 20th century these symptoms were recognised as belonging to a single medical condition. Further organ involvement was discovered along with a realisation that the condition was highly variable in its severity. The late 20th century saw great improvements in cranial imaging techniques and the discovery of the two genes. Finally the start of the 21st century saw the beginning of a molecular understanding of the illness along with possible non-surgical therapeutic treatments."

Compared to other NSAIDs it may have other side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. It increases the risk of heart failure kidney failure and liver failure. At low doses it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however at higher doses it may. Ibuprofen can also worsen asthma. While its safety in early pregnancy is unclear it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy so it is not recommended during that period. Like other NSAIDs it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ibuprofen is a weaker anti-inflammatory agent than other NSAIDs.Ibuprofen was discovered in 1961 by Stewart Adams and John Nicholson while working at Boots UK Limited and initially marketed as Brufen. It is available under a number of brand names including Nurofen Advil and Motrin. Ibuprofen was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and in 1974 in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021 it was the 36th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 17\u00a0million prescriptions."

However as dandruff may refer to any dryness or scaling of the scalp not all dandruff is seborrhoeic dermatitis.  Seborrhoeic dermatitis is sometimes inaccurately referred to as seborrhoea.The cause is unclear but believed to involve a number of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for seborrhoeic dermatitis include poor immune function Parkinson's disease and alcoholic pancreatitis. The condition may worsen with stress or during the winter. Malassezia yeast is believed to play a role. It is not a result of poor hygiene. Diagnosis is typically clinical and based on the symptoms present. The condition is not contagious.The typical treatment is topical antifungal cream and anti-inflammatory agents. Specifically ketoconazole or ciclopirox are effective. Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp is often treated with shampoo preparations of ketoconazole or zinc pyrithione.The condition is common in infants within the first three months of age or in adults aged 30 to 70 years. It tends to affect more males. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in African Americans among individuals who are immune compromised such as with HIV and individuals with Parkinson's disease."

Consequently an adult who engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent is unable to legally claim that the sexual activity was consensual and such sexual activity may be considered child sexual abuse or statutory rape.

It has sometimes been used with other meanings such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage but consent to sexual activity is the meaning now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including but not limited to the age of majority age of criminal responsibility voting age drinking age and driving age.Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18 (with the exceptions of Argentina Niger and Western Sahara which set the age of consent for 13 Mexico which sets the age of consent between 12 and 18 and 14 Muslim states and the Vatican City that set the consent by marriage only). The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act the gender of the participants or other considerations such as involving a position of trust; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor such as corruption of a minor to what is popularly called statutory rape.There are many \"grey areas\" in this area of law some regarding unspecific and untried legislation others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws.

        "article": "Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a skin condition characterised by warty skin lesions. It results from an abnormal susceptibility to HPV infection (HPV) and is associated with a high lifetime risk of squamous cell carcinomas in skin. It generally presents with scaly spots and small bumps particularly on the hands feet face and neck; typically beginning in childhood or in a young adult. The bumps tend to be flat grow in number and then merge to form plaques. On the trunk it typically appears like pityriasis versicolor; lesions there being slightly scaly and tan brown red or looking pale. On the elbows it may appear like psoriasis. On the forehead neck and trunk the lesions may appear like seborrheic keratosis.It is most frequently inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with some reports of autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance. Other types include atypical EV which develops due to gene mutations that cause an impaired immune system and acquired EV which occurs due to acquired immunodeficiency. It is characterized by an inability to protect against HPV infection of skin. HPV types 5 and 8 are detected in around 90% of skin cancers in people with EV. Other types are also associated with EV. In rare cases the warts may develop into giant horns resulting in treeman syndrome.Prevention of skin cancer requires sun protection. Treatment typically involves surgery; sometimes with the addition of skin grafting. Medications used to treat the lesions include ALA-PDT (photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid) applying 5-FU imiquimod and retinoids by mouth. The lesions tend to recur on stopping treatment.The condition is rare. The lesions have been noted to occur at a younger age in warmer climates. EV associated skin cancer develops less frequently in Africans. The condition was first described by Felix Lewandowsky and Wilhelm Lutz in 1922."

They may be flat or project out from the surface of the skin and their color may vary; brownish white pale yellow pinkish-red or gray. There may be a few individual warts or several either in a cluster or merged together to look cauliflower-shaped. They can be itchy and feel burning. Usually they cause few symptoms but can occasionally be painful. Typically they appear one to eight months following exposure. Warts are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection.HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for causing majority of genital warts whereas HPV types 16 18 31 33 and 35 are also occasionally found. It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact usually during oral manual vaginal or anal sex with an infected partner. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and can be confirmed by biopsy. The types of HPV that cause cancer are not the same as those that cause warts.Some HPV vaccines can prevent genital warts as may condoms. Treatment options include creams such as podophyllin imiquimod and trichloroacetic acid. Cryotherapy or surgery may also be an option. After treatment warts often resolve within six months. Without treatment in up to a third of cases they resolve on their own.About 1% of people in the United States have genital warts. Many people however are infected and do not have symptoms. Without vaccination nearly all sexually active people will get some type of HPV at one point in their lives. The disease has been known at least since the time of Hippocrates in 300 BC."

        "article": "Human papillomavirus infection (HPV infection) is caused by a DNA virus from the Papillomaviridae family. Many HPV infections cause no symptoms and 90% resolve spontaneously within two years. In some cases an HPV infection persists and results in either warts or precancerous lesions. These lesions depending on the site affected increase the risk of cancer of the cervix vulva vagina penis anus mouth tonsils or throat. Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV and two strains \u2013 HPV16 and HPV18 \u2013 account for 70% of all cases. HPV16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV. HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis. An HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus a DNA virus from the papillomavirus family. Over 200 types have been described. An individual can become infected with more than one type of HPV and the disease is only known to affect humans. More than 40 types may be spread through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals. Risk factors for persistent infection by sexually transmitted types include early age of first sexual intercourse multiple sexual partners smoking and poor immune function. These types are typically spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods. HPV infection can also spread from a mother to baby during pregnancy. There is no evidence that HPV can spread via common items like toilet seats but the types that cause warts may spread via surfaces such as floors. HPV is not killed by common hand sanitizers and disinfectants increasing the possibility of the virus being transferred via non-living infectious agents called fomites.HPV vaccines can prevent the most common types of infection. To be most effective inoculation should occur before the onset of sexual activity and are therefore recommended between the ages of 9\u201313 years. Cervical cancer screening such as the Papanicolaou test (\"pap smear\") or examination of the cervix after applying acetic acid can detect both early cancer and abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. Screening allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number of cases and the number of deaths from cervical cancer. Genital warts can be removed by freezing.Nearly every sexually active individual is infected by HPV at some point in their lives. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. High-risk HPVs cause about 5% of all cancers worldwide and about 37300 cases of cancer in the United States each year. Cervical cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide causing an estimated 604000 new cases and 342000 deaths in 2020. About 90% of these new cases and deaths of cervical cancer occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Roughly 1% of sexually active adults have genital warts. Cases of skin warts have been described since the time of ancient Greece but that they were caused by a virus was not determined until 1907."

They are round or oval feel flat or slightly elevated like the scab from a healing wound and range in size from very small to more than 2.5 centimetres (1\u00a0in) across. They are often associated with other skin conditions including basal cell carcinoma. Rarely seborrheic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma occur at the same location. At clinical examination the differential diagnosis include a wart and melanoma. Because only the top layers of the epidermis are involved seborrheic keratoses are often described as having a \"pasted on\" appearance. Some dermatologists refer to seborrheic keratoses as \"seborrheic warts\" because they resemble warts but strictly speaking the term \"warts\" refers to lesions that are caused by the human papillomavirus."

The term refers mainly to humans many other animals and fungi whereas for example bacteria perennial plants and some simple animals are potentially biologically immortal. In a broader sense ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing or to the population of a species.In humans ageing represents the accumulation of changes in a human being over time and can encompass physical psychological and social changes. Reaction time for example may slow with age while memories and general knowledge typically increase. Ageing is associated with increased risk of cancer Alzheimer's disease diabetes cardiovascular disease increased mental health risks and many more. Of the roughly 150000 people who die each day across the globe about two-thirds die from age-related causes.Current ageing theories are assigned to the damage concept whereby the accumulation of damage (such as DNA oxidation) may cause biological systems to fail or to the programmed ageing concept whereby the internal processes (epigenetic maintenance such as DNA methylation) inherently may cause ageing. Programmed ageing should not be confused with programmed cell death (apoptosis).Obesity has been proposed to accelerate ageing whereas dietary calorie restriction in non-primate animals slows ageing while maintaining good health and body functions. In primates (including humans) such life-extending effects remain uncertain."

As the main component of connective tissue it is the most abundant protein in mammals making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. Collagen consists of amino acids bound together to form a triple helix of elongated fibril known as a collagen helix. It is mostly found in connective tissue such as cartilage bones tendons ligaments and skin. Vitamin C is vital for collagen synthesis and Vitamin E improves the production of collagen.Depending upon the degree of mineralization collagen tissues may be rigid (bone) or compliant (tendon) or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). Collagen is also abundant in corneas blood vessels the gut intervertebral discs and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue and accounts for 6% of the weight of the skeletal muscle tissue. The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen. Gelatin which is used in food and industry is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed using heat basic solutions or weak acids."

It is a steely-grey lustrous hard and brittle transition metal.Chromium metal is valued for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use. Chromium is also greatly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing. Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the visible spectrum and almost 90% of infrared light. The name of the element is derived from the Greek word \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 chr\u014dma meaning color because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.Industrial production of chromium proceeds from chromite ore (mostly FeCr2O4) to produce ferrochromium an iron-chromium alloy by means of aluminothermic or silicothermic reactions. Ferrochromium is then used to produce alloys such as stainless steel. Pure chromium metal is produced by a different process: roasting and leaching of chromite to separate it from iron followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium.In the United States trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) ion is considered an essential nutrient in humans for insulin sugar and lipid metabolism. However in 2014 the European Food Safety Authority acting for the European Union concluded that there was insufficient evidence for chromium to be recognized as essential.While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are considered non-toxic hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is toxic and carcinogenic. According to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) chromium trioxide that is used in industrial electroplating processes is a \"substance of very high concern\" (SVHC).Abandoned chromium production sites often require environmental cleanup."

Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin a red rash bumps blisters or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening but can be very uncomfortable.Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis) or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction. Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type and represents 80% of all cases. It is caused by prolonged exposure to irritants leading to direct injury of the epidermal cells of the skin which activates an immune response resulting in an inflammatory cutaneous reaction. Phototoxic dermatitis occurs when the allergen or irritant is activated by sunlight. Diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can often be supported by patch testing."

The word \"diaper\" is in the name not because the diaper itself causes the rash but rather because the rash is associated with diaper use being caused by the materials trapped by the diaper (usually feces). Allergic contact dermatitis has also been suggested but there is little evidence for this cause. In adults with incontinence (fecal urinary or both) the rash is sometimes called incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD).The term diaper candidiasis is used when a fungal origin is identified.

The endocannabinoid signaling system (ECS) is the major pathway by which NAEs exerts its physiological effects in animal cells with similarities in plants and the metabolism of NAEs is an integral part of the ECS a very ancient signaling system being clearly present from the divergence of the protostomian/deuterostomian and even further back in time to the very beginning of bacteria the oldest organisms on Earth known to express phosphatidylethanolamine the precursor to endocannabinoids in their cytoplasmic membranes. Fatty acid metabolites with affinity for CB receptors are produced by cyanobacteria which diverged from eukaryotes at least 2000\u00a0million years ago (MYA) by brown algae which diverged about 1500 MYA by sponges which diverged from eumetazoans about 930 MYA and a lineages that predate the evolution of CB receptors as CB1 \u2013 CB2 duplication event may have occurred prior to the lophotrochozoan-deuterostome divergence 590 MYA. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) evolved relatively recently either after the evolution of fish 400 MYA or after the appearance of mammals 300 MYA but after the appearance of vertebrates. Linking FAAH vanilloid receptors (VR1) and anandamide (NAE 20:4) implies a coupling among the remaining \u2018\u2018older\u2019\u2019 parts of the endocannabinoid system monoglyceride lipase (MGL) CB receptors that evolved prior to the metazoan\u2013bilaterian divergence (ie between extant Hydra and leech) but were secondarily lost in the Ecdysozoa and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG).These amides conceptually can be formed from a fatty acid and ethanolamine with the release of a molecule of water but the known biological synthesis uses a specific phospholipase D to cleave the phospholipid unit from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines. Another route relies on the transesterification of acyl groups from phosphatidylcholine by an N-acyltransferase (NAT) activity. The suffixes -amine and -amide in these names each refer to the single nitrogen atom of ethanolamine that links the compound together: it is termed \"amine\" in ethanolamine because it is considered as a free terminal nitrogen in that subunit while it is termed \"amide\" when it is considered in association with the adjacent carbonyl group of the acyl subunit.  Names for these compounds may be encountered with either \"amide\" or \"amine\" varying by author.N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are broken down or hydrolysed by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) to ethanolamine (MEA) and their corresponding fatty acid arachidonic acid. FAAH is activated during stress exposure circumstances which also raises the neuronal excitability in the amygdala a critical brain area that mediates anxiety and the anxiolytic outcome of CB1 receptor activation. Inhibition of FAAH has been shown to increase the levels of NAEs in vivo and to produce desirable phenotypes that produce analgesic anxiolytic neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects like in high-level performance athletes (i.e. elite athletes) that present an extraordinary interindividual variability of physical but also mental traits that greatly influence their sports accomplishments and their career longevity by an FAAH genetic polymorphism that produce the SNP rs324420 (C385A allele) associated with a higher sensitivity of FAAH to proteolytic degradation and a shorter half-life as compared to the C variant as the A variant displays normal catalytic properties but an enhanced sensitivity to degradation leading to increased NAE and anandamide (AEA) signaling. Activation of the cannabinoid receptor CB1 or CB2 in different tissues including skin inhibit FAAH and thereby increases endocannabinoid levels."

        "article": "Alopecia areata also known as spot baldness is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. It often results in a few bald spots on the scalp each about the size of a coin. Psychological stress and illness are possible factors in bringing on alopecia areata in individuals at risk but in most cases there is no obvious trigger. People are generally otherwise healthy. In a few cases all the hair on the scalp is lost (alopecia totalis) or all body hair is lost (alopecia universalis). Hair loss can be permanent or temporary.Alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disease resulting from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles. Risk factors include a family history of the condition. Among identical twins if one is affected the other has about a 50% chance of also being affected. The underlying mechanism involves failure by the body to recognize its own cells with subsequent immune-mediated destruction of the hair follicle.No cure for the condition is known. Some treatments particularly triamcinolone injections and 5% minoxidil topical creams are effective in speeding hair regrowth. Sunscreen head coverings to protect from cold and sun and glasses if the eyelashes are missing are also recommended. In more than 50% of cases of sudden-onset localized \"patchy\" disease hair regrows within a year. In patients with only one or two patches this one-year recovery will occur in up to 80%. However many people will have more than one episode over the course of a lifetime. In many patients hair loss and regrowth occurs simultaneously over the course of several years. Among those in whom all body hair is lost fewer than 10% recover.About 0.15% of people are affected at any one time and 2% of people are affected at some point in time. Onset is usually in childhood. Females are affected at higher rates than males."

The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. Inflammation or scarring is not usually present. Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress.Common types include male- or female-pattern hair loss alopecia areata and a thinning of hair known as telogen effluvium. The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination of genetics and male hormones; the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy.Less common causes of hair loss without inflammation or scarring include the pulling out of hair certain medications including chemotherapy HIV/AIDS hypothyroidism and malnutrition including iron deficiency. Causes of hair loss that occurs with scarring or inflammation include fungal infection lupus erythematosus radiation therapy and sarcoidosis. Diagnosis of hair loss is partly based on the areas affected.Treatment of pattern hair loss may simply involve accepting the condition which can also include shaving one's head. Interventions that can be tried include the medications minoxidil (or finasteride) and hair transplant surgery. Alopecia areata may be treated by steroid injections in the affected area but these need to be frequently repeated to be effective. Hair loss is a common problem. Pattern hair loss by age 50 affects about half of men and a quarter of women. About 2% of people develop alopecia areata at some point in time."

        "article": "Pattern hair loss (also known as androgenetic alopecia (AGA)) is a hair loss condition that primarily affects the top and front of the scalp. In male-pattern hair loss (MPHL) the hair loss typically presents itself as either a receding front hairline loss of hair on the crown (vertex) of the scalp or a combination of both. Female-pattern hair loss (FPHL) typically presents as a diffuse thinning of the hair across the entire scalp.Genetic research has identified alleles associated with male pattern hair loss. These alleles appear to be undergoing positive sexual selection in European and East Asian populations as male pattern baldness may be seen as a masculine attribute associated with seniority and higher social status.  The condition is caused by a combination of male sex hormones (balding never occurs in castrated men) and genetic factors.Some research has found evidence for the role of oxidative stress in hair loss the microbiome of the scalp genetics and circulating androgens; particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Men with early onset androgenic alopecia (before the age of 35) have been deemed the male phenotypic equivalent for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear; androgenetic alopecia for women is associated with an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Management may include simply accepting the condition or shaving one's head to improve the aesthetic aspect of the condition. Otherwise common medical treatments include minoxidil finasteride dutasteride or hair transplant surgery. Use of finasteride and dutasteride in women is not well-studied and may result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.By the age of 50 pattern hair loss affects about half of males and a quarter of females. It is the most common cause of hair loss. Both males aged 40\u201391 and younger male patients of early onset AGA (before the age of 35) had a higher likelihood of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and insulin resistance. With younger males studies found metabolic syndrome to be at approximately a 4\u00d7 increased frequency which is clinically deemed significant. Abdominal obesity hypertension and lowered high density lipoprotein were also significantly higher for younger groups."

A brief positive feeling may occur as hair is removed. Efforts to stop pulling hair typically fail. Hair removal may occur anywhere; however the head and around the eyes are most common. The hair pulling is to such a degree that it results in distress and hair loss can be seen.As of 2023 the specific cause or causes of trichotillomania are unclear. Trichotillomania is probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The disorder may run in families. It occurs more commonly in those with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Episodes of pulling may be triggered by anxiety. People usually acknowledge that they pull their hair and broken hairs may be seen on examination. Other conditions that may present similarly include body dysmorphic disorder; however in that condition people remove hair to try to improve what they see as a problem in how they look.Treatment is typically with cognitive behavioral therapy. The medication clomipramine may also be helpful as will keeping fingernails clipped. Trichotillomania is estimated to affect one to four percent of people. Trichotillomania most commonly begins in childhood or adolescence. Women are affected about 10 times more often than men.

The sugars are usually a combination of N-acetylgalactosamine D-glucose or D-galactose. One characteristic of globosides is that the \"core\" sugars consists of Glucose-Galactose-Galactose (Ceramide-\u03b2Glc4-1\u03b2Gal4-1\u03b1Gal) like in the case of the most basic globoside globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) also known as pk-antigen. Another important characteristic of globosides is that they are neutral at pH 7 because they usually do not contain neuraminic acid a sugar with an acidic carboxy-group. However some globosides with the core structure Cer-Glc-Gal-Gal do contain neuraminic acid e.g. the globo-series glycosphingolipid \"SSEA-4-antigen\".The side chain can be cleaved by galactosidases and glucosidases. The deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase A causes Fabry's disease an inherited metabolic disease characterized by the accumulation of the globoside globotriaosylceramide.Globoside (GB4) has been known as the receptor for parvovirus B19 due to observations that B19V binds to the thin-layered chromatogram of the structure.  However the binding on its surface does not match well with the virus which raised debates on whether or not GB4 is the cause for productive infection. Additional research using the technique Knockout Cell Line has shown that although GB4 does not have the direct entry receptor for B19V it plays a post-entry role in productive infection.Globoside (Gb4) are a type of SSEA stage-specific embryonic antigen that is present in cellular development and tumorous tissues without the mechanism of Gb4 being completely known. However a study has shown Gb4 directly activates the epidermal growth factor receptor through a ERK signaling. When the globo-series glycosphingolipid (GSL) was reduced in the experiment the ERK signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase was also inhibited. The ERK was reactivated with the addition of the Gb4 and henceforth heightened proliferation of tumorous cells and opened up the possibility of testing Gb4 for further studies on potential drugs that can target cancerous cells."

Lysosomes are sacs of enzymes within cells that digest large molecules and pass the fragments on to other parts of the cell for recycling. This process requires several critical enzymes. If one of these enzymes is defective due to a mutation the large molecules accumulate within the cell eventually killing it.Lysosomal storage disorders are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids glycoproteins (sugar-containing proteins) or so-called mucopolysaccharides.  Individually lysosomal storage diseases occur with incidences of less than 1:100000; however as a group the incidence is about 1:5000 \u2013 1:10000.  Most of these disorders are autosomal recessively inherited such as Niemann\u2013Pick disease type C but a few are X-linked recessively inherited such as Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome (MPS II).The lysosome is commonly referred to as the cell's recycling center because it processes unwanted material into substances that the cell can use.  Lysosomes break down this unwanted matter by enzymes highly specialized proteins essential for survival. Lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether.  When this happens substances accumulate in the cell.  In other words when the lysosome does not function normally excess products destined for breakdown and recycling are stored in the cell.Like other genetic disorders individuals inherit lysosomal storage diseases from their parents.  Although each disorder results from different gene mutations that translate into a deficiency in enzyme activity they all share a common biochemical characteristic \u2013 all lysosomal disorders originate from an abnormal accumulation of substances inside the lysosome.Lysosomal storage diseases affect mostly children and they often die at a young age many within a few months or years of birth."

In the human body amyloids have been linked to the development of various diseases. Pathogenic amyloids form when previously healthy proteins lose their normal structure and physiological functions (misfolding) and form fibrous deposits within and around cells. These protein misfolding and deposition processes disrupt the healthy function of tissues and organs.Such amyloids have been associated with (but not necessarily as the cause of) more than 50 human diseases known as amyloidosis and may play a role in some neurodegenerative diseases. Some of these diseases are mainly sporadic and only a few cases are familial. Others are only familial. Some result from medical treatment. Prions are an infectious form of amyloids that can act as a template to convert other non-infectious forms. Amyloids may also have normal biological functions; for example in the formation of fimbriae in some genera of bacteria transmission of epigenetic traits in fungi as well as pigment deposition and hormone release in humans.Amyloids have been known to arise from many different proteins. These polypeptide chains generally form \u03b2-sheet structures that aggregate into long fibers; however identical polypeptides can fold into multiple distinct amyloid conformations. The diversity of the conformations may have led to different forms of the prion diseases.An unusual secondary structure named \u03b1 sheet has been proposed as the toxic constituent of amyloid precursor proteins but this idea is not widely accepted at present."

There are several non-specific and vague signs and symptoms associated with amyloidosis. These include fatigue peripheral edema weight loss shortness of breath palpitations and feeling faint with standing. In AL amyloidosis specific indicators can include enlargement of the tongue and periorbital purpura. In wild-type ATTR amyloidosis non-cardiac symptoms include: bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome lumbar spinal stenosis biceps tendon rupture small fiber neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction.There are about 36 different types of amyloidosis each due to a specific protein misfolding. Within these 36 proteins 19 are grouped into localized forms 14 are grouped as systemic forms and three proteins can identify as either. These proteins can become irregular due to genetic effects as well as through acquired environmental factors. The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are light chain (AL) inflammation (AA) dialysis-related (A\u03b22M) and hereditary and old age (ATTR and wild-type transthyretin amyloid).Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine organ enlargement is present or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why. Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy. Due to the variable presentation a diagnosis can often take some time to reach.Treatment is geared towards decreasing the amount of the involved protein. This may sometimes be achieved by determining and treating the underlying cause. AL amyloidosis occurs in about 3\u201313 per million people per year and AA amyloidosis in about two per million people per year. The usual age of onset of these two types is 55 to 60 years old. Without treatment life expectancy is between six months and four years. In the developed world about one per 1000 deaths are from systemic amyloidosis. Amyloidosis has been described since at least 1639."

Amyloid a misfolded and insoluble protein can become a deposit in the heart's atria valves or ventricles. These deposits can cause thickening of different sections of the heart leading to decreased cardiac function. The overall decrease in cardiac function leads to a plethora of symptoms. This multisystem disease was often misdiagnosed with a corrected analysis only during autopsy. Advancements of technologies have increased earlier accuracy of diagnosis. Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple sub-types including light chain familial and senile. One of the most studied types is light chain cardiac amyloidosis. Prognosis depends on the extent of the deposits in the body and the type of amyloidosis.

Its a very rare recessive disease genetically determined with a chronic course.It was characterized in 1981. Mutation of the POLA1 gene lead to loss of expression of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-\u03b1 and is responsible for XLPDR. Loss of POLA1 expression resulted in reduced levels of RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytosol and unexpectedly triggered aberrant immune responses (e.g. type I interferon production) which in part can account for the symptoms associated with XLPDR. Another trigger of the immunodeficiency phenotype is a functional deficiency of Natural killer (NK) cells which are major players in innate antiviral immune system."

These contrast with benign tumors which do not spread. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump abnormal bleeding prolonged cough unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer they can also have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% are due to obesity poor diet lack of physical activity or excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors include certain infections exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. Infection with specific viruses bacteria and parasites is an environmental factor causing approximately 16-18% of cancers worldwide.  These infectious agents include Helicobacter pylori hepatitis B hepatitis C human papillomavirus infection Epstein\u2013Barr virus Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus.  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not directly cause cancer but it causes immune deficiency that can magnify the risk due to other infections sometimes up to several thousand fold (in the case of Kaposi's sarcoma). Importantly vaccination against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus have been shown to nearly eliminate risk of cancers caused by these viruses in persons successfully vaccinated prior to infection.  These environmental factors act at least partly by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5\u201310% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking maintaining a healthy weight limiting alcohol intake eating plenty of vegetables fruits and whole grains vaccination against certain infectious diseases limiting consumption of processed meat and red meat and limiting exposure to direct sunlight. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy surgery chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at diagnosis the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%. For cancer in the United States the average five-year survival rate is 66% for all ages.In 2015 about 90.5\u00a0million people worldwide had cancer. In 2019 annual cancer cases grew by 23.6\u00a0million people and there were 10 million deaths worldwide representing over the previous decade increases of 26% and 21% respectively.The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer and stomach cancer. In females the most common types are breast cancer colorectal cancer lung cancer and cervical cancer. If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year it would account for around 40% of cases. In children acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common except in Africa where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often. In 2012 about 165000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer. The risk of cancer increases significantly with age and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries. Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world. The global total economic costs of cancer were estimated at US$1.16\u00a0trillion (equivalent to $1.62 trillion in 2023) per year as of 2010."

He interned at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1948 to 1952 he was a post-doctoral fellow in the department of physiological chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and fellow in clinical medicine in the department of medicine. In collaboration with Samuel Gurin at the University of Pennsylvania Brady discovered the enzyme system for the biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids and later discovered the role of malonate coenzyme A in this process. After two and one-half years on active duty in the U.S. Naval Medical Corps he joined the National Institutes of Health in 1954. He was Chief of the Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke from 1972 to 2006. Dr. Brady and his colleagues identified the enzymatic defects in Gaucher's disease Niemann\u2013Pick disease Fabry disease and the specific metabolic abnormality in Tay\u2013Sachs disease. He and his associates developed diagnostic carrier detection prenatal tests for these conditions and effective enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Gaucher disease and Fabry disease.  These were the first-ever enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) treatments for lysosomal diseases and directly led to great advances in the development of enzyme replacement therapies for some of the other lysosomal diseases by many different researchers who were inspired by Dr. Brady.  (An international research and development effort for new ERT for several devastating lysosomal diseases continues today at an intense pace and numerous ERT clinical trials are underway.)  Late in his life Dr. Brady was investigating substrate depletion molecular chaperone therapy and gene therapy for patients with metabolic storage disorders.Among his numerous awards Dr. Brady received the Borden Undergraduate Award from Harvard Medical School in 1947; the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1973; the Cotzias Award from the American Academy of Neurology in 1980; the Passano Foundation Award and the Lasker Foundation Award in 1982; the Sachs Award from the Child Neurology Society in 1990; the Kovalenko Medal from the National Academy of Sciences USA in 1991; and the Alpert Foundation Prize from Harvard Medical School in 1992.  He received an honorary PhD degree from the University of Uppsala in 2005.  Dr. Brady was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2008 by President George W. Bush.  He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.Dr. Brady died on June 13 2016 at his home in Rockville MD with his wife and sons at his side after a long battle with cancer."

It works by decreasing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by about 70%.In addition to DHT finasteride also inhibits the production of several anticonvulsant neurosteroids including allopregnanolone androstanediol and THDOC.Adverse effects from finasteride are rare; however some men experience sexual dysfunction depression and breast enlargement. In some men sexual dysfunction may persist after stopping the medication. It may also hide the early symptoms of certain forms of prostate cancer.Finasteride was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1992. It is available as a generic medication.

PRP is derived from the patient's own blood and may contain growth factors that increase collagen production. It can be applied topically to the entire treatment area during and after collagen induction therapy treatments or injected intradermally to scars. Efficacy of the combined treatments remains in question pending scientific studies.More serious safety concerns have been cited for these treatments popularly known as vampire facials when performed in non-medical settings by people untrained in infection control. The New Mexico Department of Health issued a statement that at least one such business offering vampire facials \"could potentially spread blood-borne infections such as HIV hepatitis B and hepatitis C to clients\".In April 2024 the CDC announced that three women who had been patients at the Albuquerque New Mexico VIP Spa had been diagnosed with HIV after getting \"vampire facials\" there.

These fibers are able to stretch many times their length and snap back to their original length when relaxed without loss of energy. Elastic fibers include elastin elaunin and oxytalan.Elastic fibers are formed via elastogenesis a highly complex process involving several key proteins including fibulin-4 fibulin-5 latent transforming growth factor\u00a0\u03b2 binding protein 4 and microfibril associated protein 4. In this process tropoelastin the soluble monomeric precursor to elastic fibers is produced by elastogenic cells and chaperoned to the cell surface. Following excretion from the cell tropoelastin self associates into ~200\u00a0nm particles by coacervation an entropically driven process involving interactions between tropoelastin's hydrophobic domains which is mediated by glycosaminoglycans heparan and other molecules. These particles then fuse to give rise to 1-2 micron spherules which continue to grow as they move down from the cells surface before being deposited onto fibrillin microfibrillar scaffolds.Following deposition onto microfibrils tropoelastin is insolubilized via extensive crosslinking by members of the lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase like family of copper-dependent amine oxidases into amorphous elastin a highly resilient insoluble polymer that is metabolically stable over a human lifespan. These two families of enzymes react with the many lysine residues present in tropoelastin to form reactive aldehydes and allysine via oxidative deamination.These reactive aldehydes and allysines can react with other lysine and allysine residues to form desmosine isodesmosine and a number of other polyfunctional crosslinks that join surrounding molecules of tropoelastin into an extensively crosslinked elastin matrix. This process creates a diverse array of intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinks  These unique crosslinks are responsible for elastin's durability and persistence. Maintenance of crosslinked elastin is carried out by a number of proteins including lysyl oxidase-like 1 protein.Mature elastic fibers consist of an amorphous elastin core surrounded by a glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate and number of other proteins such as microfibrillar-associated glycoproteins fibrillin fibullin and the elastin receptor."

Skin biopsies are also done by family physicians internists surgeons and other specialties.

These dilated blood vessels can develop anywhere on the body but are commonly seen on the face around the nose cheeks and chin. Dilated blood vessels can also develop on the legs although when they occur on the legs they often have underlying venous reflux or \"hidden varicose veins\" (see Venous hypertension section below). When found on the legs they are found specifically on the upper thigh below the knee joint and around the ankles.Many patients with spider veins seek the assistance of physicians who specialize in vein care or peripheral vascular disease. These physicians are called vascular surgeons or phlebologists. More recently interventional radiologists have started treating venous problems.Some telangiectasias are due to developmental abnormalities that can closely mimic the behaviour of benign vascular neoplasms. They may be composed of abnormal aggregations of arterioles capillaries or venules. Because telangiectasias are vascular lesions they blanch when tested with diascopy.Telangiectasias aside from presenting in many other conditions are one of the features of the acronymically named CREST syndrome a form of systemic scleroderma.

AFSTs are slow-growing often painless tumors composed primarily of spindle-shaped cells and a prominent vascular network. The spindle-shaped cells are benign tumor cells that in almost all cases have chromosome abnormalities that are thought to contribute to their abnormal development and/or growth. AFST tumors are commonly treated by surgical excision although in uncommon cases they recur at the site of their removal and require further surgical treatment. They do not metastasize to distant tissues and overall have a good prognosis."

The condition can last for days to years. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips).Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection irritation or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. aureus. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures licking the lips or drooling mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth sun exposure overclosure of the mouth smoking and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste makeup and food. Often a number of factors are involved. Other factors may include poor nutrition or poor immune function. Diagnosis may be helped by testing for infections and patch testing for allergies.Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. Frequently an antifungal and antibacterial cream is also tried. Angular cheilitis is a fairly common problem with estimates that it affects 0.7% of the population. It occurs most often in people in their 30s to 60s and is also relatively common in children. In the developing world iron vitamin B12 and other vitamin deficiencies are a common cause."

Symptoms typically include a burning pain followed by small blisters or sores. The first attack may also be accompanied by fever sore throat and enlarged lymph nodes. The rash usually heals within ten days but the virus remains dormant in the trigeminal ganglion. The virus may periodically reactivate to create another outbreak of sores in the mouth or lip.The cause is usually herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and occasionally herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The infection is typically spread between people by direct non-sexual contact. Attacks can be triggered by sunlight fever psychological stress or a menstrual period. Direct contact with the genitals can result in genital herpes. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms but can be confirmed with specific testing.Prevention includes avoiding kissing or using the personal items of a person who is infected. A zinc oxide anesthetic or antiviral cream appears to decrease the duration of symptoms by a small amount. Antiviral medications may also decrease the frequency of outbreaks.About 2.5 per 1000 people are affected with outbreaks in any given year. After one episode about 33% of people develop subsequent episodes. Onset often occurs in those less than 20 years old and 80% develop antibodies for the virus by this age. In those with recurrent outbreaks these typically happen less than three times a year. The frequency of outbreaks generally decreases over time."

The resulting scaling redness chapping and crusting makes a well-defined ring around the lips. The rash may extend as far as the tongue can reach and usually does not occur at the corners of the mouth. It commonly occurs during winter months but some people can have it year-round if lip licking is a chronic habit.Lip licker's dermatitis differs from perioral dermatitis which spares the vermilion border. Allergic contact dermatitis presents similar signs and symptoms that can be differentiated from lip licker's dermatitis with an allergy patch skin test. It is treated with simple moisturizers emollients and sometimes topical steroids while perioral dermatitis is worsened by topical steroids. It is important to identify the cause of the inflammation whether it is due to lip licking or a more complex cause in order to successfully treat and alleviate symptoms. Children are affected more often than adults and sometimes special approaches need to be considered especially if there is a psychological aspect to the lip licking behavior."

Less commonly the eyes and genitalia may be involved. It can be persistent or recurring and resembles particularly rosacea and to some extent acne and allergic dermatitis. The term \"dermatitis\" is a misnomer because this is not an eczematous process.The cause is unclear. Topical steroids are associated with the condition and moisturizers and cosmetics may contribute. The underlying mechanism may involve blockage of the skin surface followed by subsequent excessive growth of skin flora. Fluoridated toothpaste and some micro-organisms including Candida may also worsen the condition but their roles in this condition are unclear. It is considered a disease of the hair follicle with biopsy samples showing microscopic changes around the hair follicle. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.Treatment is typically by stopping topical steroids changing cosmetics and in more severe cases taking tetracyclines by mouth. Stopping steroids may initially worsen the rash. The condition is estimated to affect 0.5-1% of people a year in the developed world.

        "article": "Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are inserted into the body. Acupuncture is a pseudoscience; the theories and practices of TCM are not based on scientific knowledge and it has been characterized as quackery.There is a range of acupuncture technological variants which originated in different philosophies and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed. However it can be divided into two main foundational philosophical applications and approaches; the first form being the modern standardized form called eight principles TCM and the second an older system that is based on the ancient Daoist wuxing better known as the five elements or phases in the West. Acupuncture is most often used to attempt pain relief though acupuncturists say that it can also be used for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.The global acupuncture market was worth US$24.55 billion in 2017. The market was led by Europe with a 32.7% share followed by Asia-Pacific with a 29.4% share and the Americas with a 25.3% share. It was estimated in 2021 that the industry would reach a market size of $55bn by 2023.The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture generally provide no good evidence of benefit which suggests that it is not an effective method of healthcare. Acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single-use needles. When properly delivered it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. When accidents and infections do occur they are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner particularly in the application of sterile techniques. A review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade. The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. Since serious adverse events continue to be reported it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi meridians and acupuncture points and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (qi) or meridians which was a major part of early belief systems. Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100\u00a0BC in China around the time The Inner Classic of Huang Di (Huangdi Neijing) was published though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier. Over time conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar celestial and earthly cycles yin and yang energies and a body's \"rhythm\" on the effectiveness of treatment. Acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in China due to changes in the country's political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or scientific medicine. Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD then to Japan through medical missionaries and then to Europe beginning with France. In the 20th century as it spread to the United States and Western countries spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflicted with scientific knowledge were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points."

As of 2011 approximately 26000 practitioners had been given A4M certificates.  The field of anti-aging medicine is not recognized by established medical organizations such as the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Medical Association (AMA). The academy's activities include lobbying and public relations. The A4M was founded in 1993 by osteopathic physicians Robert M. Goldman and Ronald Klatz and as of 2013 claimed 26000 members from 120 countries.Several of the anti-aging methods recommended by the academy have wide support among experts in the field such as exercise and a healthy diet but others such as hormone treatments do not have support from a consensus of the wider medical community. Many scientists studying aging dissociate themselves from the claims of A4M and critics have accused the group of using misleading marketing to sell expensive and ineffective products. The A4M's founders and merchants who promote products through the organization have been involved in legal and professional disputes.The activities of the A4M are controversial: in 2003 a commentary on the response of the scientific community to the promotion of anti-aging medicine noted that the activities of the A4M were seen as a threat to the credibility of serious scientific research on aging. According to MSNBC anti-aging advocates have responded to such criticism by describing it as censorship perpetrated by a conspiracy of the US government notably the Food and Drug Administration the AMA and the mainstream media motivated by competing commercial interests. Tom Perls of the Boston University School of Medicine a prominent critic of the organization has stated that claims of censorship and suppression are a common theme in what he calls \"anti-aging quackery\"."

Once formed an ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection.The two most common causes of oral ulceration are local trauma (e.g. rubbing from a sharp edge on a broken filling or braces biting one's lip etc.) and aphthous stomatitis (\"canker sores\") a condition characterized by the recurrent formation of oral ulcers for largely unknown reasons. Mouth ulcers often cause pain and discomfort and may alter the person's choice of food while healing occurs (e.g. avoiding acidic sugary salty or spicy foods and beverages)."

Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be poisonous. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue."

In rare cases the skin may blister. Athlete's foot fungus may infect any part of the foot but most often grows between the toes. The next most common area is the bottom of the foot. The same fungus may also affect the nails or the hands. It is a member of the group of diseases known as tinea.Athlete's foot is caused by a number of different funguses including species of Trichophyton Epidermophyton and Microsporum. The condition is typically acquired by coming into contact with infected skin or fungus in the environment. Common places where the funguses can survive are around swimming pools and in locker rooms. They may also be spread from other animals. Usually diagnosis is made based on signs and symptoms; however it can be confirmed either by culture or seeing hyphae using a microscope.Athlete's foot is not limited to just athletes: it can be caused by going barefoot in public showers letting toenails grow too long wearing shoes that are too tight or not changing socks daily. It can be treated with topical antifungal medications such as clotrimazole or for persistent infections using oral antifungal medications such as terbinafine. Topical creams are typically recommended to be used for four weeks. Keeping infected feet dry and wearing sandals also assists with treatment.Athlete's foot was first medically described in 1908. Globally athlete's foot affects about 15% of the population. Males are more often affected than females. It occurs most frequently in older children or younger adults. Historically it is believed to have been a rare condition that became more frequent in the 20th century due to the greater use of shoes health clubs war and travel."

Excessive sweating of the feet and use of occlusive footwear provide an environment in which these bacteria thrive and therefore increase the risk of developing pitted keratolysis.The condition is fairly common especially in the military where wet shoes/boots are worn for extended periods of time without removing/cleaning. Skin biopsy specimens are not usually utilized as the diagnosis of pitted keratolysis is often made by visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. Wood's lamp examination results are inconsistent. Treatment of pitted keratolysis requires the application of antibiotics to the skin such as benzoyl peroxide clindamycin erythromycin fusidic acid or mupirocin. Prevention efforts aim to keep the feet dry by using moisture-wicking shoes and socks as well as antiperspirants."

Clear fluid may come from the affected areas which can thicken over time. AD may also simply be called eczema a term that generally refers to a larger group of skin conditions.Atopic dermatitis affects about 20% of people at some point in their lives. It is more common in younger children. Females are slightly more affected than males. Many people outgrow the condition.While the condition may occur at any age it typically starts in childhood with changing severity over the years. In children under one year of age the face and limbs and much of the body may be affected. As children get older the areas on the insides of the knees and folds of the elbows and around the neck are most commonly affected. In adults the hands and feet are commonly affected. Scratching the affected areas worsens the eczema and increases the risk of skin infections. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop hay fever or asthma.The cause is unknown but believed to involve genetics immune system dysfunction environmental exposures and difficulties with the permeability of the skin. If one identical twin is affected the other has an 85% chance of having the condition. Those who live in cities and dry climates are more commonly affected. Exposure to certain chemicals or frequent hand washing makes symptoms worse. While emotional stress may make the symptoms worse it is not a cause. The disorder is not contagious. A diagnosis is typically based on the signs symptoms and family history.Treatment involves avoiding things that make the condition worse enhancing the skin barrier through skin care and treating the underlying skin inflammation. Moisturising creams are used to make the skin less dry and prevent AD flare-ups. Anti-inflammatory corticosteroid creams are used to control flares-ups. Creams based on calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) may also be used to control flares if other measures are not effective. Certain antihistamine pills might help with itchiness. Things that commonly make it worse include house dust mite stress and seasonal factors. Phototherapy may be useful in some people. Antibiotics (either by mouth or topically) are usually not helpful unless there is secondary bacterial infection or the person is unwell. Dietary exclusion does not benefit most people and it is only needed if food allergies are suspected. More severe AD cases may need systemic medicines such as cyclosporin methotrexate dupilumab or baricitinib.Other names of the condition include \"infantile eczema\" \"flexural eczema\" \"prurigo Besnier\" \"allergic eczema\" and \"neurodermatitis\"."

Allergic diseases are clinical manifestations of such inappropriate atopic responses.Atopy may have a hereditary component although contact with the allergen or irritant must occur before the hypersensitivity reaction can develop (characteristically after re-exposure). Maternal psychological trauma in utero may also be a strong indicator for development of atopy.The term atopy was coined by Arthur F. Coca and Robert Cooke in 1923. Many physicians and scientists use the term \"atopy\" for any IgE-mediated reaction (even those that are appropriate and proportional to the antigen) but many pediatricians reserve the word \"atopy\" for a genetically mediated predisposition to an excessive IgE reaction. The term is from Greek \u1f00\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1 meaning \"the state of being out of place\" \"absurdity\"."

In cases of short duration there may be small blisters while in long-term cases the skin may become thickened. The area of skin involved can vary from small to covering the entire body. Dermatitis is often called eczema and the difference between those terms is not standardized.The exact cause of the condition is often unclear. Cases may involve a combination of allergy and poor venous return. The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash. For example irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of those who frequently get them wet. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs upon exposure to an allergen causing a hypersensitivity reaction in the skin.Prevention of atopic dermatitis is typically with essential fatty acids and may be treated with moisturizers and steroid creams. The steroid creams should generally be of mid-to high strength and used for less than two weeks at a time as side effects can occur. Antibiotics may be required if there are signs of skin infection. Contact dermatitis is typically treated by avoiding the allergen or irritant. Antihistamines may help with sleep and decrease nighttime scratching.Dermatitis was estimated to affect 245 million people globally in 2015 or 3.34% of the world population. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type and generally starts in childhood. In the United States it affects about 10\u201330% of people. Contact dermatitis is twice as common in females as in males. Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 7% of people at some point in their lives. Irritant contact dermatitis is common especially among people with certain occupations; exact rates are unclear."

Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include pustular psoriasis and scabies.Avoiding triggers may be useful as may a barrier cream. Treatment is generally with steroid cream. High strength steroid creams may be required for the first week or two. Antihistamines may be used to help with the itch. If this is not effective steroid pills tacrolimus or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) may be tried.About 1 in 2000 people are affected in Sweden. Males and females appear to be affected equally. It explains about one in five cases of hand dermatitis. The first description was in 1873. The name comes from the word \"dyshidrotic\" meaning \"difficult sweating\" as problems with sweating was once believed to be the cause."

It is a short Gram-positive homofermentative facultative anaerobic non-spore-forming rod that often appears in chains. Some strains of L. rhamnosus bacteria are being used as probiotics and are particularly useful in treating infections of the female urogenital tract most particularly very difficult to treat cases of bacterial vaginosis (or \"BV\"). The species Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri  are commonly found in the healthy female genito-urinary tract and are helpful to regain control of dysbiotic bacterial overgrowth during an active infection. L. rhamnosus sometimes is used in dairy products such as fermented milk and as non-starter-lactic acid bacterium (NSLAB) in long-ripened cheese. While frequently considered a beneficial organism L. rhamnosus may not be as beneficial to certain subsets of the population; in rare circumstances especially those primarily involving weakened immune system or infants it may cause endocarditis. Despite the rare infections caused by L. rhamnosus the species is included in the list of bacterial species with qualified presumed safety (QPS) status of the European Food Safety Agency."

It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected) thighs face back and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands and tops of legs sides or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy type 1 diabetes mellitus obesity dry skin allergic diseases (e.g. atopic dermatitis) and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes.The cause of KP is not completely understood. As of 2018 KP is thought to be due to abnormalities in the process of depositing the protein keratin in hair follicles abnormalities in the hair shaft or both. KP is usually diagnosed by a medical professional based on the appearance of the skin but dermoscopy can be used as well if the diagnosis is unclear. Variants of the ABCA12 gene have been associated with KP.KP is the most common disorder of the hair follicle in children. How common it is in adults is unclear since keratosis pilaris is an underreported condition and the actual prevalence of the condition may be higher than estimated. No single approach has been found to completely cure KP but treatments can improve the cosmetic appearance of the condition. Treatment includes the application of topical preparations of moisturizers and medications such as glycolic acid lactic acid salicylic acid urea or retinoids to the skin. Fractional carbon dioxide lasers and Nd:YAG laser therapies are also effective."

Some dermatologic conditions aside from pruritic folliculitis during pregnancy include \"pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy atopic eruption of pregnancy pemphigoid gestationis intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and pustular psoriasis of pregnancy\". This pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy differs from typical pruritic folliculitis; in pregnancy it is characterized by sterile hair follicles becoming inflamed mainly involving the trunk contrasting how typical pruritic folliculitis is mainly localized on \"the upper back shoulders and chest.\" This condition was first observed after some pregnant individuals showed signs of folliculitis that were different than seen before.  The inflammation was thought to be caused by hormonal imbalance infection from bacteria fungi viruses or even an ingrown hair. However there is no known definitive cause as of yet. These bumps usually begin on the belly and then spread to upper regions of the body as well as the thighs.This condition does not harm the fetus or the mother and usually resolves after delivery of the baby. The rate of incidence could possibly be higher but due to the unknown etiology of the condition misdiagnosis and varying levels of severity it is difficult to differentiate. Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy is currently classified as atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP) in a retrospective study done in 2006 that compared this condition to eczema and prurigo of pregnancy which occurred in 49.7% and 0.8% of cases respectively with eczema clearly being more frequent. Unlike typical pruritic folliculitis which does not resolve on its own pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy clears spontaneously on delivery or in postpartum period. Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy has no mortality effects or significant adverse effects on the mother or on the fetus.Currently there are no treatment guidelines for this condition due to the nature of its unknown etiology but symptom relief is strongly emphasized using non-pharmacological interventions such as warm baths or wearing loose clothing. If itchiness and discomfort persists benzoyl peroxide low to mid potency topical steroids or antihistamines can be tried. Novel treatments have also shown potential in treating case studies of pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy such as using ultraviolet phototherapy. However further investigation is still required to study its efficacy and safety in second to third trimester pregnant patients."

Some skin changes are known to occur in people who are pregnant while other skin conditions or dermatoses that people have prior to getting pregnant will become altered or symptoms will increase. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) is one of many skin conditions that is specific to pregnancy and occurs in about 1 in every 160 (0.625%) of pregnancies.It presents no long-term risk for either the woman or fetus as there is no statistical increase of risk of premature labor or fetal loss despite frequently severe pruritus.PUPPP usually first appears on the abdomen and often spreads to the legs feet arms chest and neck. The face is usually not affected. Skin distension (stretching) is thought to be a possible trigger for PUPPP as it most commonly affects primigravida (women in their first pregnancy) those with large fundal measurements (distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus) and/or those who are carrying large babies or multiples. The papules and plaques often first appear within stretch marks before changing appearance and spreading to other areas of the body.For those who may be experiencing signs and symptoms of PUPPP it is strongly recommended they speak with their primary care physician and receive a consult from a dermatologist regarding skin changes during pregnancy."

All Olympic venues were scattered throughout Northern Utah and the Wasatch Front. In November 1989 Utah's voters passed the Olympic referendum which allowed construction to begin on a few of the future Olympic venues with the 1998 Winter Olympics on the mind.The construction was to proceed using public funds which would be repaid with profits following the games. As part of the referendum the state created the Utah Sports Authority who would work closely with the Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee and other Olympic organizers to ensure the venues complied with Olympic standards. Two years later Salt Lake City lost its bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympicsbut the plans continued. By the time Salt Lake City bid again the venues had been completed in 1995. On June 16 1995 the International Olympic Committee awarded Salt Lake City the XIX Winter Olympics with the newly completed venues cited as one of the key factors in the successful bid.The Utah Sports Authority constructed two of the Olympic venues: the Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval. Prior to the games the authority turned over ownership of the venues to the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) who turned the ownership of the venues over to the Utah Athletic Foundation after the games."

Some prominent ROS are hydroperoxide (O2H) superoxide (O2-) hydroxyl radical (OH.) and singlet oxygen.  ROS are pervasive because they are readily produced from O2 which is abundant.  ROS are important in many ways both beneficial and otherwise.  ROS function as signals that turn on and off biological functions.  They are intermediates in the redox behavior of O2 which is central to fuel cells.  ROS are central to the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the atmosphere.  Most often however ROS are discussed in a biological context ranging from their effects on aging and their role in causing dangerous genetic mutations.  "

They block acetylcholine from binding to cholinergic receptors namely the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.These agents have broad effects due to their actions in nerves located vastly over the body. These nerves include motor nerves in somatic nervous system which innervate skeletal muscles as well as nerves in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Organs that receive innervations from these systems include exocrine glands heart eyes gastrointestinal tract etc. Antimuscarinic and antinicotinic agents can increase heart rate inhibit secretions and gastrointestinal motility.Naturally occurring antimuscarinics were found in alkaloids from Belladonna (Solanaceae) plants. They were used as deadly poison and pupil-dilating cosmetics. While curare the naturally occurring antinicotinics derived from Chondrodendron and Strychnos was a poison used by South American Indians for hunting.According to their site of actions cholinergic blocking drugs can be classified into two general types \u2014 antimuscarinic and antinicotinic agents. Antimuscarinic agents (also known as muscarinic antagonists) including atropine and hyoscine block acetylcholine at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Antinicotinic agents (also known as ganglionic blockers neuromuscular blockers) including tubocurarine and hexamethonium block acetylcholine action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Their effects are based on the expression of corresponding receptors in different parts of the body.There are many adverse effects interactions and contraindications for antinicotinic and antimuscarinic agents. Adverse effects include hypotension dry mouth dry eyes etc. They interact with grapefruit juice and various medications e.g. warfarin metoclopramide. Therefore cautions should be exercised and advice from medical professionals should be sought before using medications."

The exact mechanism of the phenomenon is poorly understood. It is attributed to the perception in the hypothalamus (brain) that the body temperature is too high. The sweating is induced to reduce body heat.Excessive sweating due to nervousness anger previous trauma or fear is called hyperhidrosis.Compensatory hyperhidrosis is the most common side effect of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy a surgery to treat severe focal hyperhidrosis often affecting just one part of the body.  It may also be called rebound or  reflex hyperhidrosis.  In a small number of individuals compensatory hyperhidrosis following sympathectomy is disruptive because affected individuals may have to change sweat-soaked clothing two or three times a day.According to Dr. Hooshmand sympathectomy permanently damages the temperature regulatory system. The permanent destruction of thermoregulatory function of the sympathetic nervous system causes latent complications e.g. RSD in contralateral extremity.Following surgery for axillary (armpit) palmar (palm) hyperhidrosis (see focal hyperhidrosis) and blushing the body may sweat excessively at untreated areas most commonly the lower back and trunk but can be spread over the total body surface below the level of the cut. The upper part of the body above the sympathetic chain transection the body becomes anhidrotic where the patient is unable to sweat or cool down which further compromises the body's thermoregulation and can lead to elevated core temperature overheating and hyperthermia. Below the level of the sympathetic chain interruption body temperature is significantly lower creating a stark contrast that can be observed on thermal images. The difference in temperatures between the sympathetically under- and overactive regions can be as high as 10 Celsius."

        "article": "Circumcision is a procedure that removes the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common form of the operation the foreskin is extended with forceps then a circumcision device may be placed after which the foreskin is excised. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is generally used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. Circumcision is generally electively performed most commonly done as a form of preventive healthcare as a religious obligation or as a cultural practice. It is also an option for cases of phimosis other pathologies that do not resolve with other treatments and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). The procedure is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.The procedure is associated with reduced rates of sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections. This includes reducing the incidence of cancer-causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV) and significantly reducing HIV transmission among heterosexual men in high-risk populations; its prophylactic efficacy against HIV transmission in the developed world or among men who have sex with men is debated. Neonatal circumcision decreases the risk of penile cancer. Complication rates increase significantly with age. Bleeding infection and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common acute complications while meatal stenosis is the most common long-term. There are various cultural social and ethical views on circumcision. Major medical organizations hold variant views on the strength of circumcision's prophylactic efficacy in developed countries. Some medical organizations take the position that it carries prophylactic health benefits which outweigh the risks while other medical organizations generally hold the belief that in these situations its medical benefits are not counterbalanced by risk.    Circumcision is one of the world's most common and oldest medical procedures. Prophylactic usage originated in England during the 1850s and subsequently widely spread becoming predominately established as a way to prevent sexually transmitted infections. Beyond use as a prophylactic or treatment option in healthcare circumcision plays a major role in many of the world's cultures and religions most prominently Judaism and Islam. Circumcision is among the most important commandments in Judaism. It is widespread in Australia Canada the United States South Korea most of Africa and parts of Asia. It is relatively rare for non-religious reasons in parts of Southern Africa Latin America Europe and parts of Asia. The origin of circumcision is not known with certainty; the oldest documentation comes from ancient Egypt."

A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults it may result in pain during an erection but is otherwise not painful. Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans known as balanitis and other complications. In young boys it is normal not to be able to pull back the foreskin at all. Over 90% of cases resolve by the age of seven although full retraction is still prevented by preputial adhesions in over half at this age. Occasionally phimosis may be caused by an underlying condition such as scarring due to balanitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans. This can typically be diagnosed by seeing scarring of the opening of the foreskin.Typically the condition resolves without treatment by the age of 18. Efforts to pull back the foreskin during the early years of a young male's life should not be attempted. For those in whom the condition does not improve further time can be given or a steroid cream may be used to attempt to loosen the tight skin. If this method combined with stretching exercises is not effective then other treatments such as circumcision may be recommended. A potential complication of phimosis is paraphimosis where the tight foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans."

The word is from Latin: scabere lit.\u2009'to scratch'. The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally tiny burrows may appear on the skin. In a first-ever infection the infected person usually develops symptoms within two to six weeks. During a second infection symptoms may begin within 24 hours. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists between fingers or along the waistline. The head may be affected but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection in the skin.Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis an ectoparasite. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sexual activity or living together. Spread of the disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions such as those found in child-care facilities group homes and prisons increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease not essentially different but an infestation by very large numbers of mites that typically only affects those with a poor immune system; the number of mites also makes them much more contagious. In these cases spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is very small and at the limit of detection with the human eye.  It is not readily obvious; factors that aid in detection are good lighting magnification and knowing what to look for. Diagnosis is based either on detecting the mite (confirmed scabies) detecting typical lesions in a typical distribution with typical historical features (clinical scabies) or detecting atypical lesions or atypical distribution of lesions with only some historical features present (suspected scabies).Several medications are available to treat those infected including oral and topical ivermectin and permethrin crotamiton and lindane creams. Sexual contacts within the last month and people who live in the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue retreatment may be needed.Scabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections. As of 2015 it affects about 204\u00a0million people (2.8% of the world population). It is equally common in both sexes. The young and the old are more commonly affected. It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates.Other animals do not spread human scabies; similar infection in other animals is known as sarcoptic mange and is typically caused by slightly different but related mites."

It often appears as a painless raised area of skin which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. It may also present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light having lighter skin radiation therapy long-term exposure to arsenic and poor immune-system function. Exposure to UV light during childhood is particularly harmful. Tanning beds have become another common source of ultraviolet radiation. Diagnosis often depends on skin examination confirmed by tissue biopsy.It remains unclear whether sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Treatment is typically by surgical removal. This can be by simple excision if the cancer is small; otherwise Mohs surgery is generally recommended. Other options include electrodesiccation and curettage cryosurgery topical chemotherapy photodynamic therapy laser surgery or the use of imiquimod a topical immune-activating medication. In the rare cases in which distant spread has occurred chemotherapy or targeted therapy may be used.Basal-cell cancer accounts for at least 32% of all cancers globally. Of skin cancers other than melanoma about 80% are basal-cell cancers. In the United States about 35% of white males and 25% of white females are affected by BCC at some point in their lives.Basal-cell carcinoma is named after the basal cells that form the lowest layer of the epidermis. It is thought to develop from the folliculo\u2013sebaceous\u2013apocrine germinative cells called trichoblasts (of note trichoblastic carcinoma is a term sometimes used to refer to a rare type of aggressive skin cancer that may resemble a benign trichoblastoma and can also closely resemble basal cell carcinoma)."

People with NBCCS are prone to developing various cancers including a common and usually non-life-threatening form of non-melanoma skin cancer called basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs). Only about 10% of people with the condition do not develop BCCs; the vast majority of patients develop numerous BCCs.The name Gorlin syndrome refers to the American oral pathologist and human geneticist Robert J. Gorlin (1923\u20132006). The American dermatologist Robert W. Goltz (1923\u20132014) was his co-author which is the basis for the term 'Gorlin-Goltz syndrome'.First described in 1960 by Gorlin and Goltz NBCCS is an autosomal dominant condition that can cause unusual facial appearances and a predisposition for basal-cell carcinoma a type of skin cancer which rarely spreads to other parts of the body. The prevalence is reported to be 1 case per 56000\u2013164000 population. Recent work in molecular genetics has shown NBCCS to be caused by mutations in the PTCH (Patched) gene found on chromosome arm 9q or SUFU gene on chromosome arm 10q though some patients do not have either known mutation. PTCH is important in regulating cell division and growth thus mutations in this gene can impact tumor growth. Children who inherit the defective gene from either parent will also have the disorder."

SGc can be divided into 2 types: periocular and extraocular. The periocular region is rich in sebaceous glands making it a common site of origin. The cause of these lesions in the vast majority of cases is unknown. Occasional cases may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. SGc accounts for approximately 0.7% of all skin cancers and the incidence of SGc is highest in Caucasian Asian and Indian populations. Due to the rarity of this tumor and variability in clinical and histological presentation SGc is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition or a more common neoplasm.

        "article": "Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in humans. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC) squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin that may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size shape color has irregular edges has more than one color is itchy or bleeds.More than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell skin cancers total exposure irrespective of when it occurs is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with lighter skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy.Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell skin cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as fluorouracil. Treatment of melanoma may involve some combination of surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy and targeted therapy. In those people whose disease has spread to other areas of the body palliative care may be used to improve quality of life. Melanoma has one of the higher survival rates among cancers with over 86% of people in the UK and more than 90% in the United States surviving more than 5 years.Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer globally accounting for at least 40% of cancer cases. The most common type is nonmelanoma skin cancer which occurs in at least 2\u20133 million people per year. This is a rough estimate however as good statistics are not kept. Of nonmelanoma skin cancers about 80% are basal-cell cancers and 20% squamous-cell skin cancers. Basal-cell and squamous-cell skin cancers rarely result in death. In the United States they were the cause of less than 0.1% of all cancer deaths. Globally in 2012 melanoma occurred in 232000 people and resulted in 55000 deaths. White people in Australia New Zealand and South Africa have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. The three main types of skin cancer have become more common in the last 20 to 40 years especially regions where the population is predominantly White."

This causes the infected cells to divide excessively and is associated with the development of various non-cancerous pre-cancerous and cancerous lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). These LPDs include the well-known disorder occurring during the initial infection with the EBV infectious mononucleosis and the large number of subsequent disorders that may occur thereafter. The virus is usually involved in the development and/or progression of these LPDs although in some cases it may be an \"innocent\" bystander i.e. present in but not contributing to the disease.EBV-associated LPDs are a subcategory of EBV-associated diseases. Non-LPD that have significant percentages of cases associated with EBV infection (see Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection) include the immune disorders of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus; malignancies such as stomach cancers soft tissue sarcomas leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal cancer; the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome; and acute cerebellar ataxia.About 95% of the world's population is infected with EBV. During the initial infection the virus may cause infectious mononucleosis only minor non-specific symptoms or no symptoms. Regardless of this the virus enters a latency phase in its host and the infected individual becomes a lifetime asymptomatic carrier of EBV. Weeks months years or decades thereafter a small percentage of these carriers particularly those with an immunodeficiency develop an EBV+ LPD. Worldwide EBV infection is associated with 1% to 1.5% of all cancers. The vast majority of these EBV-associated cancers are LPD. The non-malignant premalignant and malignant forms of EBV+ LPD have a huge impact on world health.The classification and nomenclature of the LPD reported here follow the revisions made by the World Health Organization in 2016. This classification divides EBV+ LPD into five categories: EBV-associated reactive lymphoid proliferations EBV-associated B cell lymphoproliferative disorders EBV-associated NK/T cell lymphoproliferative disorders EBV-associated immunodeficiency-related lymphoproliferative disorders and EBV-associated histiocytic-dendritic disorders."

        "article": "A rheumatoid nodule is a lump of tissue or an area of swelling that appears on the exterior of the skin usually around the olecranon (tip of the elbow) or the interphalangeal joints (finger knuckles) but can appear in other areas. There are four different types of rheumatoid nodules: subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules cardiac nodules pulmonary nodules and central nervous systems nodules. These nodules occur almost exclusively in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Very rarely do rheumatoid nodules occur as rheumatoid nodulosis (multiple nodules on the hands or other areas) in the absence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules can also appear in areas of the body other than the skin. Less commonly they occur in the lining of the lungs or other internal organs. The occurrence of nodules in the lungs of miners exposed to silica dust was known as Caplan\u2019s syndrome. Rarely the nodules occur at diverse sites on body (e.g. upper eyelid distal region of the soles of the feet vulva and internally in the gallbladder lung heart valves larynx and spine).Rheumatoid nodules can vary in size from 2\u00a0mm to 5\u00a0cm and are usually rather firm to the touch. Quite often they are associated with synovial pockets or bursae. About 5% of people with rheumatoid arthritis have such nodules within two years of disease onset and the cumulative prevalence is about 20\u201330%. Risk factors of developing rheumatoid nodules include as smoking and trauma to small vessels.In the majority of the time nodules are not painful or disabling in any way. They are usually more of an unsightly nuisance. However rheumatoid nodules can become painful when infection or ulcers occur on the skin of the nodule. Some nodules may disappear over time but other may grow larger making nodular size difficult to predict.Treatment of rheumatoid nodules can be quite difficult but both surgical removal and injection of corticosteroids have shown good results."

Diagnosis is based on symptoms.While not curable treatment usually improves symptoms. Treatment is typically with metronidazole doxycycline  minocycline or tetracycline. When the eyes are affected azithromycin eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream ivermectin cream and isotretinoin. Dermabrasion or laser surgery may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.Rosacea affects between 1% and 10% of people. Those affected are most often 30 to 50 years old and female. People with paler skin or European ancestry are more frequently affected. The condition was described in The Canterbury Tales in the 1300s and possibly as early as the 200s BC by Theocritus."

It lives in soil and wet decaying wood often in an area close to a waterway such as a lake river or stream. Indoor growth may also occur for example in accumulated debris in damp sheds or shacks. The fungus is endemic to parts of eastern North America particularly boreal northern Ontario southeastern Manitoba Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River parts of the U.S. Appalachian mountains and interconnected eastern mountain chains the west bank of Lake Michigan the state of Wisconsin and the entire Mississippi Valley including the valleys of some major tributaries such as the Ohio River. In addition it occurs rarely in Africa both north and south of the Sahara Desert as well as in the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent. Though it has never been directly observed growing in nature it is thought to grow there as a cottony white mold similar to the growth seen in artificial culture at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F). In an infected human or animal however it converts in growth form and becomes a large-celled budding yeast. Blastomycosis is generally readily treatable with systemic antifungal drugs once it is correctly diagnosed; however delayed diagnosis is very common except in highly endemic areas."

        "article": "Blastomycosis also known as Gilchrist's disease is a fungal infection typically of the lungs which can spread to brain stomach intestine and skin where it appears as crusting purplish warty plaques with a roundish bumpy edge and central depression. Only about half of people with the disease have symptoms which can include fever cough night sweats muscle pains weight loss chest pain and fatigue. Symptoms usually develop between three weeks and three months after breathing in the spores. In 25% to 40% of cases the infection also spreads to other parts of the body such as the skin bones or central nervous system. Although blastomycosis is especially dangerous for those with weak immune systems most people diagnosed with blastomycosis have healthy immune systems.Blastomyces dermatitidis is found in the soil and decaying organic matter like wood or leaves. Outdoor activities like hunting or camping in wooded areas increase the risk of developing blastomycosis. There is no vaccine but the risk of the disease can be reduced by not disturbing the soil. Treatment is typically with an azole drug such as itraconazole for mild or moderate disease. In severe cases patients are treated with amphotericin B before azole treatment. In either event the azole treatment lasts for 6\u201312 months. Overall 4-6% of people who develop blastomycosis die; however if the central nervous system is involved this rises to 18%. People with AIDS or on medications that suppress the immune system have the highest risk of death at 25-40%.Blastomycosis is endemic to the eastern United States and Canada especially the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River valley. In these areas there are about 1 to 2 cases per 100000 per year. Less frequently blastomycosis also occurs in Africa the Middle East India and western North America. Blastomycosis also affects a broad range of non-human mammals and dogs in particular are an order of magnitude more likely to contract the disease than humans. The ecological niche of Blastomyces in the wild is poorly understood and it is unknown if there are any significant host animals.Blastomycosis has existed for millions of years but was first described by Thomas Caspar Gilchrist in 1894. Because of this it is sometimes called \"Gilchrist's disease\"."

Different types are traditionally divided according to the part of the body affected; superficial subcutaneous and systemic. Superficial fungal infections include common tinea of the skin such as tinea of the body groin hands feet and beard and yeast infections such as pityriasis versicolor. Subcutaneous types include eumycetoma and chromoblastomycosis which generally affect tissues in and beneath the skin. Systemic fungal infections are more serious and include cryptococcosis histoplasmosis pneumocystis pneumonia aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Signs and symptoms range widely. There is usually a rash with superficial infection. Fungal infection within the skin or under the skin may present with a lump and skin changes. Pneumonia-like symptoms or meningitis may occur with a deeper or systemic infection.Fungi are everywhere but only some cause disease. Fungal infection occurs after spores are either breathed in come into contact with skin or enter the body through the skin such as via a cut wound or injection. It is more likely to occur in people with a weak immune system. This includes people with illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and people taking medicines such as steroids or cancer treatments. Fungi that cause infections in people include yeasts molds and fungi that are able to exist as both a mold and yeast. The yeast Candida albicans can live in people without producing symptoms and is able to cause both superficial mild candidiasis in healthy people such as oral thrush or vaginal yeast infection and severe systemic candidiasis in those who cannot fight infection themselves.Diagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms microscopy culture sometimes requiring a biopsy and the aid of medical imaging. Some superficial fungal infections of the skin can appear similar to other skin conditions such as eczema and lichen planus. Treatment is generally performed using antifungal medicines usually in the form of a cream or by mouth or injection depending on the specific infection and its extent. Some require surgically cutting out infected tissue.Fungal infections have a world-wide distribution and are common affecting more than one billion people every year. An estimated 1.7 million deaths from fungal disease were reported in 2020. Several including sporotrichosis chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma are neglected.A wide range of fungal infections occur in other animals and some can be transmitted from animals to people."

This controversy also depends on the exact CIS in question (i.e. cervical skin breast). Some authors do not classify them as cancer however recognizing that they can potentially become cancer. Others classify certain types as a non-invasive form of cancer. The term \"pre-cancer\" has also been used.These abnormal cells grow in their normal place thus \"in situ\" (from Latin for \"in its place\"). For example carcinoma in situ of the skin also called Bowen's disease is the accumulation of dysplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only that has failed to penetrate into the deeper dermis. For this reason CIS will usually not form a tumor. Rather the lesion is flat (in the skin cervix etc.) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast lung etc.). Exceptions include CIS of the colon (polyps) the bladder (preinvasive papillary cancer) or the breast (ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ).Many forms of CIS have a high probability of progression into cancer and therefore removal may be recommended; however progression of CIS is known to be highly variable and not all CIS becomes invasive cancer.In the TNM classification carcinoma in situ is reported as TisN0M0 (stage 0)."

Bleeding can occur internally or externally either through a natural opening such as the mouth nose ear urethra vagina or anus or through a puncture in the skin.Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically a healthy person can endure a loss of 10\u201315% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison blood donation typically takes 8\u201310% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and is an important part of both first aid and surgery."

        "article": "Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma which constitutes 55% of blood fluid is mostly water (92% by volume) and contains proteins glucose mineral ions and hormones. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (erythrocytes) white blood cells (leukocytes) and (in mammals) platelets (thrombocytes). The most abundant cells are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to it increasing its solubility. Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood.Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body and venous blood carries carbon dioxide a waste product of metabolism produced by cells from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. Blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated.Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- hemato- haemo- or haemato- from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 (haima) for \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen."

These vessels transport blood cells nutrients and oxygen to the tissues of the body. They also take waste and carbon dioxide away from the tissues. Blood vessels are needed to sustain life because all of the body's tissues rely on their functionality.There are five types of blood vessels: the arteries which carry the blood away from the heart; the arterioles; the capillaries where the exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues occurs; the venules; and the veins which carry blood from the capillaries back towards the heart.The word vascular meaning relating to the blood vessels is derived from the Latin vas meaning vessel. Some structures \u2013 such as cartilage the epithelium and the lens and cornea of the eye \u2013 do not contain blood vessels and are labeled avascular."

        "article": "A bruise also known as a contusion is a type of hematoma of tissue the most common cause being capillaries damaged by trauma causing localized bleeding that extravasates into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Most bruises occur close enough to the epidermis such that the bleeding causes a visible discoloration. The bruise then remains visible until the blood is either absorbed by tissues or cleared by immune system action. Bruises which do not blanch under pressure can involve capillaries at the level of skin subcutaneous tissue muscle or bone. Bruises are not to be confused with other similar-looking lesions. Such lesions include petechia (less than 3\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0in) resulting from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin straining asphyxiation platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus); and purpura (3\u201310\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.39\u00a0in)) classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicating various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia. Additionally although many terminology schemas treat an ecchymosis (plural ecchymoses) (over 1\u00a0cm (0.39\u00a0in)) as synonymous with a bruise in some other schemas an ecchymosis is differentiated by its remoteness from the source and cause of bleeding with blood dissecting through tissue planes and settling in an area remote from the site of trauma or even nontraumatic pathology such as in periorbital ecchymosis (\"raccoon eyes\") arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma.As a type of hematoma a bruise is always caused by internal bleeding into the interstitial tissues which does not break through the skin usually initiated by blunt trauma which causes damage through physical compression and deceleration forces. Trauma sufficient to cause bruising can occur from a wide variety of situations including accidents falls and surgeries. Disease states such as insufficient or malfunctioning platelets other coagulation deficiencies or vascular disorders such as venous blockage associated with severe allergies can lead to the formation of purpura which is not to be confused with trauma-related bruising/contusion. If the trauma is sufficient to break the skin and allow blood to escape the interstitial tissues the injury is not a bruise but bleeding a different variety of hemorrhage. Such injuries may be accompanied by bruising elsewhere."

        "article": "The glomerulus (pl.: glomeruli) is a network of small blood vessels (capillaries) known as a tuft  located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. Each of the two kidneys contains about one million nephrons. The tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium (the space between the blood vessels) composed of intraglomerular mesangial cells. The blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule. The filtrate then enters the renal tubule of the nephron.The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration.The glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman's capsule constitute a renal corpuscle the basic filtration unit of the kidney. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli and thus the measure of the overall kidney function is the glomerular filtration rate."

        "article": "The lymphatic system or lymphoid system is an organ system in vertebrates that is part of the immune system and complementary to the circulatory system. It consists of a large network of lymphatic vessels lymph nodes lymphoid organs lymphatic tissue and lymph. Lymph is a clear fluid carried by the lymphatic vessels back to the heart for re-circulation. The Latin word for lymph lympha refers to the deity of fresh water \"Lympha\".Unlike the circulatory system that is a closed system the lymphatic system is open. The human circulatory system processes an average of 20 litres of blood per day through capillary filtration which removes plasma from the blood. Roughly 17 litres of the filtered blood is reabsorbed directly into the blood vessels while the remaining three litres are left in the interstitial fluid. One of the main functions of the lymphatic system is to provide an accessory return route to the blood for the surplus three litres.The other main function is that of immune defense. Lymph is very similar to blood plasma in that it contains waste products and cellular debris together with bacteria and proteins. The cells of the lymph are mostly lymphocytes. Associated lymphoid organs are composed of lymphoid tissue and are the sites either of lymphocyte production or of lymphocyte activation. These include the lymph nodes (where the highest lymphocyte concentration is found) the spleen the thymus and the tonsils. Lymphocytes are initially generated in the bone marrow. The lymphoid organs also contain other types of cells such as stromal cells for support. Lymphoid tissue is also associated with mucosas such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).Fluid from circulating blood leaks into the tissues of the body by capillary action carrying nutrients to the cells. The fluid bathes the tissues as interstitial fluid collecting waste products bacteria and damaged cells and then drains as lymph into the lymphatic capillaries and lymphatic vessels. These vessels carry the lymph throughout the body passing through numerous lymph nodes which filter out unwanted materials such as bacteria and damaged cells. Lymph then passes into much larger lymph vessels known as lymph ducts. The right lymphatic duct drains the right side of the region and the much larger left lymphatic duct known as the thoracic duct drains the left side of the body. The ducts empty into the subclavian veins to return to the blood circulation. Lymph is moved through the system by muscle contractions. In some vertebrates a lymph heart is present that pumps the lymph to the veins.The lymphatic system was first described in the 17th century independently by Olaus Rudbeck and Thomas Bartholin."

Erythrocytes take up oxygen in the lungs or in fish the gills and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.The cytoplasm of a red blood cell is rich in hemoglobin an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270\u00a0million hemoglobin molecules. The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability of the blood cell while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.In humans mature red blood cells are flexible biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus (which is expelled during development) and organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4\u00a0million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults. The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100\u2013120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages.  Each circulation takes about 60 seconds (one minute). Approximately 84% of the cells in the human body are the 20\u201330\u00a0trillion red blood cells. Nearly half of the blood's volume (40% to 45%) is red blood cells.Packed red blood cells are red blood cells that have been donated processed and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion."

There are two components to a thrombus: aggregated platelets and red blood cells that form a plug and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein. The substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor. A thrombus is a healthy response to injury intended to stop and prevent further bleeding but can be harmful in thrombosis when a clot obstructs blood flow through healthy blood vessels in the circulatory system.In the microcirculation consisting of the very small and smallest blood vessels the capillaries tiny thrombi known as microclots can obstruct the flow of blood in the capillaries. This can cause a number of problems particularly affecting the alveoli in the lungs of the respiratory system resulting from reduced oxygen supply. Microclots have been found to be a characteristic feature in severe cases of COVID-19 and in long COVID.Mural thrombi are thrombi that adhere to the wall of a large blood vessel or heart chamber. They are most commonly found in the aorta the largest artery in the body more often in the descending aorta and less often in the aortic arch or abdominal aorta. They can restrict blood flow but usually do not block it entirely. They appear grey-red along with alternating light and dark lines (known as lines of Zahn) which represent bands of white blood cells and red blood cells (darker) entrapped in layers of fibrin."

Therefore most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example conditions of the mucous membrane) morphology (chronic blistering conditions) cause (skin conditions resulting from physical factors) and so on.Clinically the diagnosis of any particular skin condition begins by gathering pertinent information of the presenting skin lesion(s) including: location (e.g. arms head legs); symptoms (pruritus pain); duration (acute or chronic); arrangement (solitary generalized annular linear); morphology (macules papules vesicles); and color (red yellow etc.). Some diagnoses may also require a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data. The introduction of cutaneous ultrasound has allowed the detection of cutaneous tumors inflammatory processes and skin diseases."

The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis is unclear but believed to involve calcification of the small blood vessels located within the fatty tissue and deeper layers of the skin blood clots and eventual death of skin cells due to lack of blood flow. It is seen mostly in people with end-stage kidney disease but can occur in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease and rarely in people with normally functioning kidneys. Calciphylaxis is a rare but serious disease believed to affect 1-4% of all dialysis patients. It results in chronic non-healing wounds and indicates poor prognosis with typical life expectancy of less than one year.Calciphylaxis is one type of extraskeletal calcification. Similar extraskeletal calcifications are observed in some people with high levels of calcium in the blood including people with milk-alkali syndrome sarcoidosis primary hyperparathyroidism and hypervitaminosis D. In rare cases certain medications such as warfarin can also result in calciphylaxis."

It is either given by injection into a vein or applied to the skin.Side effects may include vomiting joint pain mood changes psychosis and ringing in the ears. Safety however has not been well studied. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Its use at the same time in the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin is not recommended. In cyanide poisoning sodium nitrite creates methemoglobinemia which removes cyanide from the mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate then binds with cyanide creating the nontoxic thiocyanate.Sodium thiosulfate came into medical use for cyanide poisoning in the 1930s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines."

It can be defined as an excess in the blood of amino acid and protein metabolism end products such as urea and creatinine which would be normally excreted in the urine. Uremic syndrome can be defined as the terminal clinical manifestation of kidney failure (also called renal failure). It is the signs symptoms and results from laboratory tests which result from inadequate excretory regulatory and endocrine function of the kidneys. Both uremia and uremic syndrome have been used interchangeably to denote a very high plasma urea concentration that is the result of renal failure. The former denotation will be used for the rest of the article.Azotemia is a similar less severe condition with high levels of urea where the abnormality can be measured chemically but is not yet so severe as to produce symptoms. Uremia describes the pathological and symptomatic manifestations of severe azotemia.There is no specific time for the onset of uremia for people with progressive loss of kidney function. People with kidney function below 50% (i.e. a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] between 50 and 60 mL/min) and over 30 years of age may have uremia to a degree. This means an estimated 8 million people in the United States with a GFR of less than 60 mL/min have uremic symptoms.  The symptoms such as fatigue can be very vague making the diagnosis of impaired kidney function difficult. Treatment can be by dialysis or a kidney transplant though some patients choose to pursue symptom control and conservative care instead."

It also has an artisanal mining business Gemfair which operates in Sierra Leone.From its inception in 1888 until the start of the 21st century De Beers controlled 80% to 85% of rough diamond distribution and was considered a monopoly. As of 2000 the company's control of the world diamond supply decreased to 63%.The company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild &amp; Sons bank. In 1926 Ernest Oppenheimer a German immigrant to Britain and later South Africa who had earlier founded mining company Anglo American with American financier J. P. Morgan was elected to the board of De Beers. He built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the diamond industry until his death in 1957. During this time he was involved in a number of controversies including price fixing and trust behaviour and was accused of not releasing industrial diamonds for the U.S. war effort during World War II.In 2011 Anglo American took control of De Beers after buying the Oppenheimers' family stake of 40% for US$5.1 billion (\u00a33.2 billion) and increasing its stake to 85% ending the 80-year Oppenheimer control of the company.In April 2024 Anglo American announced its intention to spin off or sell De Beers.

Pledger made his first appearance as Mason during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2016. Mason was introduced to the show along with his three older siblings; Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) Justin Morgan (James Stewart) and Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood). Mason is portrayed as being a positive family orientated \"free spirit\". He is studying to be a doctor like his sister who he shares a close bond with. For the first few weeks after their arrival Mason and his siblings concealed the fact that they were in witness protection. Mason was the first member of the family to reveal the secret which resulted in them being held hostage. Subsequent storylines for Mason have revolved around his romantic relationships with Evelyn MacGuire (Phillipa Northeast) Olivia Fraser Richards (Raechelle Banno) and Beth Ellis (Anneliese Apps) with the latter helping to bring awareness to organ donation in Australia. The character has also been used to show the effects of temporary paralysis after he is injured in a car crash with his brother Brody.

It may occur as a single event or subsequent bouts may cause further spread. It is most common in males.:\u200a829\u200a It is named after Jay Frank Schamberg who described it in 1901. There is no known cure for this disease but it is not a life-threatening condition and is mainly of cosmetic concern although because it can appear so suddenly so extensively and because it usually leaves permanent discoloration of the skin it can cause understandable psychological concern. The skin lesions sometimes cause itching which can be treated by applying cortisone cream.  The cortisone cream will only help with the itching and does not improve the discoloration of the skin. Schamberg's disease causes no other symptoms beside skin discoloration and itching. The condition is caused by inflammation of capillaries near the surface of skin and subsequent leaking of red blood cells into surrounding tissues. As the red blood cells break down and get mostly resorbed some of the iron released by the red blood cells remains in the skin and causes the characteristic rust-colored appearance. The cause of the capillary inflammation is usually unknown."

CM can be considered an umbrella term for various vascular anomalies caused by increased diameter or number of capillary blood vessels. It is commonly referred to as \"port-wine stain\" and is thought to affect approximately 0.5% of the population. Typically capillaries in the papillary dermis are involved and this gives rise to pink or violaceous colored lesions. The majority of DCMO lesions are diffuse reticulated pale-colored stains.DCMO is a unique entity from previously described vascular syndromes including: Klippel\u2013Trenaunay syndrome macrocephaly-capillary malformation syndrome cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita CLOVES syndrome and Proteus syndrome. Careful evaluation must be made to rule out these vascular-complex syndromes from the differential diagnosis as DCMO is considered a more common and benign condition."

Other names include capillary hemangioma \"strawberry hemangioma\":\u200a593\u200a strawberry birthmark and strawberry nevus. and formerly known as a cavernous hemangioma. They appear as a red or blue raised lesion on the skin. Typically they begin during the first four weeks of life  growing until about five months of life and then shrinking in size and disappearing over the next few years. Often skin changes remain after they shrink. Complications may include pain bleeding ulcer formation disfigurement or heart failure. It is the most common tumor of orbit and periorbital areas in childhood. It may occur in the skin subcutaneous tissues and mucous membranes of oral cavities and lips as well as in extracutaneous locations including the liver and gastrointestinal tract.The underlying reason for their occurrence is not clear. In about 10% of cases they appear to run in families. A few cases are associated with other abnormalities such as PHACE syndrome. Diagnosis is generally based on the symptoms and appearance. Occasionally medical imaging can assist in the diagnosis.In most cases no treatment is needed other than close observation. Hemangiomas may grow rapidly before stopping and slowly fading with maximum improvement typically occurring by the age of 3.5 years. While this birthmark may be alarming in appearance physicians generally counsel that it be left to disappear on its own unless it is in the way of vision or blocking the nostrils. Certain cases however may result in problems and the use of medication such as propranolol or steroids are recommended.

It is characterized by a brain with an average weight that is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean of the general population. Approximately 1 out of 50 children (2%) are said to have the characteristics of megalencephaly in the general population.A mutation in the PI3K-AKT pathway is believed to be the primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of megalencephaly. This mutation has produced a classification of brain overdevelopment that consists of two syndromes including megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH). Megalencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an MRI.There are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with megalencephaly; however studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of MEG. Although no treatment currently exists for megalencephaly management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism. Most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes megalencephaly."

It is named after British dermatologist Frederick Parkes Weber who first described the syndrome in 1907.In the body the vascular system consists of arteries veins and capillaries. When abnormalities such as vascular malformation capillary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and overgrowth of a limb occur together in combination and disturb the complex network of blood vessels of the vascular system it is known as PWS. The capillary malformations and AVFs are known to be present from the birth. In some cases PWS is a genetic condition where the RASA1 gene is mutated and displays an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. If PWS is genetic then most patients show multiple capillary malformations. Patients who do not have multiple capillary malformations most likely did not inherit PWS and do not have RASA1 mutations. In such cases the cause of PWS is often unknown and is sporadic as most cases often are.PWS is often confused with Klippel\u2013Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome (KTS). These two diseases are similar but they are distinct. PWS occurs because of vascular malformation that may or may not be because of genetic mutations whereas Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome is a condition in which blood vessels and or lymph vessels do not form properly. PWS and KTS almost have the same symptoms except PWS patients are seen with both AVMs and AVFs occurring with limb hypertrophy."

A vascular anomaly is a localized defect in blood or lymph vessels. These defects are characterized by an increased number of vessels and vessels that are both enlarged and sinuous. Some vascular anomalies are congenital others appear within weeks to years after birth and others are acquired by trauma or during pregnancy. Inherited vascular anomalies are also described and often present with a number of lesions that increase with age. Vascular anomalies can also be a part of a syndrome.The estimated prevalence of vascular anomalies is 4.5%. Vascular anomalies can occur throughout the whole body but in 60% of patients they are localized in the head and neck region.Vascular anomalies can present in various ways when situated deep below the skin they appear blue and are often called cavernous. Superficial vascular anomalies appear as red-coloured stains and are associated with vascular anomalies affecting the dermis. Historically vascular anomalies have been labeled with descriptive terms according to the food they resembled (port wine strawberry cherry salmon patch). This imprecise terminology has caused diagnostic confusion blocked communication and even caused incorrect treatment as it does not differentiate between various vascular anomalies. However in 1982 Mulliken introduced a classification that replaced these descriptive terms and gave direction to the management of various vascular anomalies. This classification based on clinical features natural history and cellular characteristics divides vascular anomalies into two groups: vascular tumors and vascular malformations.Although vascular tumors and vascular malformations can resemble each other there are important differences between both."

The two gluteus maximus muscles are the largest muscles in the human body. They are responsible for movements such as straightening the body into the upright (standing) posture when it is bent at the waist; maintaining the body in the upright posture by keeping the hip joints extended; and propelling the body forward via further leg (hip) extension when walking or running. In many cultures the buttocks play a role in sexual attraction. Many cultures have also used the buttocks as a primary target for corporal punishment as the buttocks' layer of subcutaneous fat offers protection against injury while still allowing for the infliction of pain."

It is characterized by hair that is silvery dry frizzy wiry and impossible to comb. It was first reported in the early 20th century. It typically becomes apparent between the ages of 3 months and 12 years. UHS has several names including pili trianguli et canaliculi (Latin) cheveux incoiffables (French) and \"spun-glass hair\". This disorder is believed to be autosomal recessive in most instances but there are a few documented cases where multiple family members display the trait in an autosomal dominant fashion. Based on the current scientific studies related to the disorder the three genes that have been causally linked to UHS are PADI3 TGM3 and TCHH. These genes encode proteins important for hair shaft formation. Clinical symptoms of the disorder arise between 3 months and 12 years of age. The quantity of hair on the head does not change but hair starts to grow more slowly and becomes increasingly \"uncombable\". To be clinically apparent 50% of all scalp hair shafts must be affected by UHS. This syndrome only affects the hair shaft of the scalp and does not influence hair growth in terms of quantity textural feel or appearance on the rest of the body."

Some blood blisters can be extremely painful due to bruising where the blister occurred.There are also blood blister-like aneurysms as these are known to be located in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and have been recognized as having unique pathological and clinical features."

        "article": " A hyfrecator is a low-powered medical apparatus used in electrosurgery on conscious patients usually in an office setting. It is used to destroy tissue directly and to stop bleeding during minor surgery. It works by emitting low-power high-frequency high-voltage AC electrical pulses via an electrode mounted on a handpiece directly to the affected area of the body. A continuous electric spark discharge may be drawn between probe and tissue especially at the highest settings of power although this is not necessary for the device to function. The amount of output power is adjustable and the device is equipped with different tips electrodes and forceps depending on the electrosurgical requirement. Unlike other types of electrosurgery the hyfrecator does not employ a dispersive electrode pad that is attached to the patient in an area not being treated and that leads back to the apparatus (sometimes loosely but not quite correctly called a \"ground pad\"). It is designed to work with non-grounded (insulated) patients.The word hyfrecator is a portmanteau derived from \u201chigh-frequency eradicator.\u201d  It was introduced as a brand name for a device introduced in 1940 by the Birtcher Corporation of Los Angeles. Birtcher also trademark registered the name Hyfrecator in 1939 and rights to the registered trademark were acquired by CONMED Corporation when it acquired Birtcher in 1995. Today machines with the name Hyfrecator are sold only by ConMed Corporation. However the word \"hyfrecator\" is sometimes used as a genericized trademark to refer to any dedicated non-ground-return electrosurgical apparatus and a number of manufacturers now produce such machines although not by this name."

It encompassed Central Europe Eastern Europe Northeast Europe (Baltics) and Southeast Europe (Balkans) and lasted from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. Of the estimated 70\u201385 million deaths attributed to World War II around 30\u00a0million occurred on the Eastern Front including 9\u00a0million children. The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations. It is noted by historian Geoffrey Roberts that \"More than 80 percent of all combat during the Second World War took place on the Eastern Front\".The Axis forces led by Nazi Germany began their advance into the Soviet Union under the codename Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941 the opening date of the Eastern Front. Initially Soviet forces were unable to halt the Axis forces which came close to Moscow. Despite their many attempts the Axis failed to capture Moscow and soon focused on the oil fields in the Caucasus. German forces invaded the Caucasus under the Fall Blau (\"Case Blue\") plan on 28 June 1942. The Soviets successfully halted further Axis advance at Stalingrad \u2014 the bloodiest battle in the war \u2014 costing the Axis powers their morale and becoming the turning point of the front.Seeing the Axis setback from Stalingrad the Soviet Union routed its forces and regained territories at its expense. The Axis defeat at Kursk terminated the German offensive strength and cleared the way for Soviet offensives. Its setbacks caused many countries friendly with Germany to defect and join the Allies such as Romania and Bulgaria. The Eastern Front concluded with the capture of Berlin followed by the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender on 8 May a day that marked the end of the Eastern Front and the War in Europe.The battles on the Eastern Front of World War II constituted the largest military confrontation in history. In pursuit of its \"Lebensraum\" settler-colonial agenda Nazi Germany waged a war of annihilation (Vernichtungskrieg) throughout Eastern Europe. Nazi military operations were characterised by vicious brutality scorched-earth tactics wanton destruction mass deportations forced starvations wholesale terrorism and massacres. These also included the genocidal campaigns of Generalplan Ost and Hunger Plan which aimed at the extermination and ethnic cleansing of more than a hundred million Eastern European natives. German historian Ernst Nolte called the Eastern Front \"the most atrocious war of conquest enslavement and annihilation known to modern history\" while British historian Robin Cross expressed that \"In the Second World War no theatre was more gruelling and destructive than the Eastern Front and nowhere was the fighting more bitter\".The two principal belligerent powers in the Eastern Front were Germany and the Soviet Union along with their respective allies. Though they never sent in ground troops to the Eastern Front the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union in the form of the Lend-Lease program along with naval and air support. The joint German\u2013Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish\u2013Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front. In addition the Soviet\u2013Finnish Continuation War is generally also considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front."

Typically the fingers and less commonly the toes are involved. Rarely the nose ears nipples or lips are affected. The episodes classically result in the affected part turning white and then blue. Often numbness or pain occurs. As blood flow returns the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes but can last several hours. The condition is named after the physician Auguste Gabriel Maurice Raynaud who first described it in his doctoral thesis in 1862.Episodes are typically triggered by cold or emotional stress. Primary Raynaud's is idiopathic (spontaneous and of unknown cause) and not correlated with another disease. Secondary Raynaud's occurs as a result of some other condition and has an older age at onset; episodes are intensely painful and can be asymmetric and associated with skin lesions. Secondary Raynaud's can occur due to a connective-tissue disorder such as scleroderma or lupus injuries to the hands prolonged vibration smoking thyroid problems and certain medications such as birth control pills and stimulants. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms.The primary treatment is avoiding the cold. Other measures include the discontinuation of nicotine or stimulant use. Medications for treatment of cases that do not improve include calcium channel blockers and iloprost. There is little evidence that alternative medicine is helpful. Severe disease may in rare cases lead to complications specifically skin sores or gangrene.About 4% of people have the condition. Onset of the primary form is typically between ages 15 and 30 and occurs more frequently in females. The secondary form usually affects older people. Both forms are more common in cold climates."

The feet may become red or bluish in color. As the condition worsens the feet can start to swell and smell of decay. Complications may include skin breakdown or infection.Trench foot occurs due to prolonged exposure of the feet to cold damp and often unsanitary conditions. Unlike frostbite trench foot usually occurs at temperatures above freezing and can be classed as a form of non-freezing cold injury. Onset can be as rapid as 10 hours. Risk factors include overly tight boots and not moving. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve constriction of blood vessels resulting in insufficient blood flow to the feet. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and examination.Prevention involves keeping the feet warm dry and clean. After the condition has occurred pain medications may be required during the gradual rewarming process. Pain may persist for months following treatment. Surgery to remove damaged tissue or amputation may be necessary.Those in the military are most commonly affected though cases may also occur in the homeless. The condition was first described during Napoleon Bonaparte's retreat from Russia in the winter of 1812. "

The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter and some use a definition based on weather.When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. Winter typically brings precipitation that depending on a region's climate is mainly rain or snow. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see: earliest and latest sunrise and sunset)."

The name is derived from the Greek root pemphix meaning \"blister\".In pemphigus autoantibodies form against desmoglein which forms the \"glue\" that attaches adjacent epidermal cells via attachment points called desmosomes. When autoantibodies attack desmogleins the cells become separated from each other and the epidermis becomes detached a phenomenon called acantholysis. This causes blisters that slough off and turn into sores. In some cases these blisters can cover a large area of the skin.Originally the cause of this disease was unknown and \"pemphigus\" was used to refer to any blistering disease of the skin and mucosa.  In 1964 researchers found that the blood of patients with pemphigus contained antibodies to the layers of skin that separate to form the blisters. In 1971 an article investigating the autoimmune nature of this disease was published."

        "article": "Ethinylestradiol (EE) is an estrogen medication which is used widely in birth control pills in combination with progestins. In the past EE was widely used for various indications such as the treatment of menopausal symptoms gynecological disorders and certain hormone-sensitive cancers. It is usually taken by mouth but is also used as a patch and vaginal ring.The general side effects of EE include breast tenderness and enlargement headache fluid retention and nausea among others. In men EE can additionally cause breast development feminization in general hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction. Rare but serious side effects include blood clots liver damage and cancer of the uterus.EE is an estrogen or an agonist of the estrogen receptors the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a synthetic derivative of estradiol a natural estrogen and differs from it in various ways. Compared to estradiol EE is more resistant to metabolism has greatly improved bioavailability when taken by mouth and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the liver and uterus. These differences make EE more favorable for use in birth control pills than estradiol though also result in an increased risk of blood clots and certain other rare adverse effects.EE was developed in the 1930s and was introduced for medical use in 1943. The medication started being used in birth control pills in the 1960s. Ethinylestradiol is found in almost all combined forms of birth control pills and is nearly the exclusive estrogen used for this purpose making it one of the most widely used estrogens.In 2021 the combination with norethisterone was the 52nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 12\u00a0million prescriptions; the version with norgestimate was the 76th most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 8\u00a0million prescriptions; the combination with levonorgestrel was the 144th most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 4\u00a0million prescriptions; the combination with etonogestrel was the 198th most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 2\u00a0million prescriptions; the combination with norgestrel was the 227th most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 2\u00a0million prescriptions; the combination with etynodiol was the 276th most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 800000 prescriptions; the combination with drospirenone and levomefolic acid was the 277th most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 800000 prescriptions;"

        "article": "Human skin color ranges from the darkest brown to the lightest hues. Differences in skin color among individuals is caused by variation in pigmentation which is the result of genetics (inherited from one's biological parents) exposure to the sun disorders or some combination thereof. Differences across populations evolved through natural selection or sexual selection because of social norms and differences in environment as well as regulations of the biochemical effects of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin.The actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances although the single most important substance is the pigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skin humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible especially in the face when as consequence of physical exercise or sexual arousal or the stimulation of the nervous system (anger embarrassment) arterioles dilate. Color is not entirely uniform across an individual's skin; for example the skin of the palm and the sole is lighter than most other skin and this is especially noticeable in darker-skinned people.There is a direct correlation between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that receive higher amounts of UVR generally located closer to the equator tend to have darker-skinned populations. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower intensity of UVR which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations. By the time modern Homo sapiens evolved all humans were dark-skinned. Some researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations (\u22482500 years) through selective sweeps. Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells.In some populations women are significantly lighter-skinned than men. However in other populations notably those of European descent men are significantly lighter-skinned than women. European women may have darker skin than European men due to the female sex hormone estrogen which darkens light skin. Women from darker-skinned populations may have evolved to lighter skin than men so their bodies could absorb more vitamin D during pregnancy  which improves calcium absorption.The social significance of differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time as demonstrated with regard to social status and discrimination."

Melanin is a dark pigment primarily responsible for skin color. Once synthesized melanin is contained in special organelles called melanosomes which can be transported to nearby keratinocytes to induce pigmentation.

        "article": "Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals and other vertebrates. Diverse bile acids are synthesized in the liver.  Bile acids are conjugated with taurine or glycine residues to give anions called bile salts.Primary bile acids are those synthesized by the liver. Secondary bile acids result from bacterial actions in the colon. In humans taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid (derivatives of cholic acid) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (derivatives of chenodeoxycholic acid) are the major bile salts.  They are roughly equal in concentration.  The salts of their 7-alpha-dehydroxylated derivatives deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid are also found with derivatives of cholic chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids accounting for over 90% of human biliary bile acids.Bile acids comprise about 80% of the organic compounds in bile (others are phospholipids and cholesterol). An increased secretion of bile acids produces an increase in bile flow. Bile acids facilitate digestion of dietary fats and oils.  They serve as micelle-forming surfactants which encapsulate nutrients facilitating their absorption. These micelles are suspended in the chyme before further processing. Bile acids also have hormonal actions throughout the body particularly through the farnesoid X receptor and GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5).It is to be noted that bile acid synthesis is the only manner in which humans or other mammals may excrete excess cholesterol as the parent compound of all bile acids is cholesterol."

Complications that occur primarily during childbirth are termed obstetric labor complications and problems that occur primarily after childbirth are termed puerperal disorders. While some complications improve or are fully resolved after pregnancy some may lead to lasting effects morbidity or in the most severe cases maternal or fetal mortality.Common complications of pregnancy include anemia gestational diabetes infections gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Presence of these types of complications can have implications on monitoring lab work imaging and medical management during pregnancy.Severe complications of pregnancy childbirth and the puerperium are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada. In the immediate postpartum period (puerperium) 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem. Long-term health problems (persisting after six months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.In 2016 complications of pregnancy childbirth and the puerperium resulted globally in 230600 deaths down from 377000 deaths in 1990. The most common causes of maternal mortality are maternal bleeding postpartum infections including sepsis hypertensive diseases of pregnancy obstructed labor and unsafe abortion.Complications of pregnancy can sometimes arise from abnormally severe presentations of symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy which usually do not significantly interfere with activities of daily living or pose any significant threat to the health of the birthing person or fetus. For example morning sickness is a fairly common mild symptom of pregnancy that generally resolves in the second trimester but hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of this symptom that sometimes requires medical intervention to prevent electrolyte imbalances from severe vomiting."

        "article": "Pregnancy is the time during which one or more offspring develops (gestates) inside a woman's uterus (womb). A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring such as with twins.Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures. A pregnancy may end in a live birth a miscarriage an induced abortion or a stillbirth. Childbirth typically occurs around 40\u00a0weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP) a span known as the gestational age. This is just over nine\u00a0months. Counting by fertilization age the length is about 38 weeks. Pregnancy is \"the presence of an implanted human embryo or fetus in the uterus\"; implantation occurs on average 8\u20139 days after fertilization. An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first seven weeks following implantation (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age) after which the term fetus is used until birth.Signs and symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods tender breasts morning sickness (nausea and vomiting) hunger implantation bleeding and frequent urination. Pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test. Methods of birth control\u2014or more accurately contraception\u2014are used to avoid pregnancy.Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters of approximately three months each. The first trimester includes conception which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. During the first trimester the possibility of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus) is at its highest. Around the middle of the second trimester movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care though babies born at this time will likely experience serious health complications such as heart and respiratory problems and long-term intellectual and developmental disabilities.Prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes. Nutrition during pregnancy is important to ensure healthy growth of the fetus.  Prenatal care may also include avoiding recreational drugs (including tobacco and alcohol) taking regular exercise having blood tests and regular physical examinations. Complications of pregnancy may include disorders of high blood pressure gestational diabetes iron-deficiency anemia and severe nausea and vomiting. In the ideal childbirth labor begins on its own \"at term\". Babies born before 37 weeks are \"preterm\" and at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy. Babies born between weeks 37 and 39 are considered \"early term\" while those born between weeks 39 and 41 are considered \"full term\". Babies born between weeks 41 and 42 weeks are considered \"late-term\" while after 42 weeks they are considered \"post-term\". Delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons."

There are donut pillows as seat cushions which serve a more favourable distribution of pressure on the abdomen as well as donut pillows to place under other parts of the body when lying down.Some shops with interior decorations offer decorative donut cushions with polyesterfilling. Seat rings (ring cushions) made of firm cold foam with cotton terrycloth covering are available in stores for medical supply. The recess in the middle serves to protect the perineum the vaginal entrance the anus and the coccyx from pressure due to the bodyweight.Donut seat cushions facilitate pain-free or at least pain-reduced sitting for women after childbirth (postpartum) when an episiotomy or perineal tear has been sutured and promote healing of the perineal suture. For people suffering from coccygeal pain medical treatment without surgery is the gold standard. This includes reduced sitting use of a donut cushion and physiotherapy. In patients undergoing heart surgery lying in supine position for hours a donut-shaped reduces injuries on the sacrum. For patients lying supine on the operating room table a nurse may place a flat donut pillow under their pelvis to provide pressure relief at the sacrum. Lying supine under anaesthesia also creates pressure points on the head which can impair skin function and also affect the blood circulation to the face possibly leading to facial skin damage. Special medical donut pillows reduce the creation of pressure points but can create shear forces on the skin so pillow design aims to avoid both problems. Gel donut pillows are available for infants and children who are hospitalised to prevent harmful pressure on the occiput in the supine position.Pressure ulcers may develop as a result of prolonged pressure on bony prominences. Their development begins in the subcutaneous tissue and often reaches the dermis and the outer skin after several days. Such tissue damage can be avoided by proper padding. Surgeries on the spinal column are performed in prone positioning. In this case gel donuts under the kneecaps are part of the positioning aids. In one study 23 patients suffering from chondrodermatitis were given a special donut-shaped pillow to place underneath while sleeping so that the affected ear was no longer subjected to pressure. Thirteen of them continued to be pain-free after a one-year follow-up period."

        "article": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of tropical infections that are common in low-income populations in developing regions of Africa Asia and the Americas. They are caused by a variety of pathogens such as viruses bacteria protozoa and parasitic worms (helminths). These diseases are contrasted with the \"big three\" infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS tuberculosis and malaria) which generally receive greater treatment and research funding. In sub-Saharan Africa the effect of neglected tropical diseases as a group is comparable to that of malaria and tuberculosis. NTD co-infection can also make HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis more deadly.Some treatments for NTDs are relatively inexpensive. For example treatment for schistosomiasis costs US$0.20 per child per year. Nevertheless in 2010 it was estimated that control of neglected diseases would require funding of between US$2\u00a0billion and $3\u00a0billion over the subsequent five to seven years. Some pharmaceutical companies have committed to donating all the drug therapies required and mass drug administration efforts (for example mass deworming) have been successful in several countries. While preventive measures are often more accessible in the developed world they are not universally available in poorer areas.Within developed countries neglected tropical diseases affect the very poorest in society. In the United States there are up to 1.46\u00a0million families including 2.8\u00a0million children living on less than two dollars per day.  In developed countries the burdens of neglected tropical diseases are often overshadowed by other public health issues. However many of the same issues put populations at risk in developed as well as developing nations. For example other problems stemming from poverty such as lack of adequate housing can expose individuals to the vectors of these diseases.Twenty neglected tropical diseases are prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) though other organizations define NTDs differently. Chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses scabies and other ectoparasites and snakebite envenomation were added to the WHO list in 2017. These diseases are common in 149 countries affecting more than 1.4\u00a0billion people (including more than 500\u00a0million children) and costing developing economies billions of dollars every year. They resulted in 142000 deaths in 2013 down from 204000 deaths in 1990."

The list is frequently used by countries to help develop their own local lists of essential medicines. As of 2016 more than 155 countries have created national lists of essential medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes both developed and developing countries.The list is divided into core items and complementary items. The core items are deemed to be the most cost-effective options for key health problems and are usable with little additional health care resources. The complementary items either require additional infrastructure such as specially trained health care providers or diagnostic equipment or have a lower cost\u2013benefit ratio. About 25% of items are in the complementary list. Some medications are listed as both core and complementary. While most medications on the list are available as generic products being under patent does not preclude inclusion.The first list was published in 1977 and included 208 medications. The WHO updates the list every two years. There are 306 medications in the 14th list in 2005 410 in the 19th list in 2015 433 in the 20th list in 2017 460 in the 21st list in 2019 and 479 in the 22nd list in 2021. Various national lists contain between 334 and 580 medications. The Essential Medicines List (EML) was updated in July 2023 to its 23rd edition. This list contains 1200 recommendations for 591 drugs and 103 therapeutic equivalents.A separate list for children up to 12 years of age known as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc) was created in 2007 and is in its 9th edition. It was created to make sure that the needs of children were systematically considered such as availability of proper formulations. Everything in the children's list is also included in the main list. The list and notes are based on the 19th to 23rd edition of the main list. Therapeutic alternatives with similar clinical performance are listed for some medicines and they may be considered for national essential medicines lists. The 9th Essential Medicines List for Children was updated in July 2023.Note: An \u03b1 indicates a medicine is on the complementary list. "

Flucytosine is used by mouth and by injection into a vein.Common side effects include bone marrow suppression loss of appetite diarrhea vomiting and psychosis. Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions occasionally occur. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Flucytosine is in the fluorinated pyrimidine analogue family of medications. It works by being converted into fluorouracil inside the fungus which impairs its ability to make protein.Flucytosine was first made in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2016 in the United States the medication cost about US$2000 per day while in the United Kingdom it is about US$22 per day.

Phaeohyphomycosis is an uncommon infection but the number of cases reported has been increasing in recent years. Fungal melanin is thought to be a virulence factor. The outcome of antifungal treatment is poor and mortality is almost 80%. Phaeohyphomycosis has been attributed to more than 100 species and 60 genera of fungi over the past several decades. The pathogens are considered opportunistic. Almost all cases of widely disseminated infection have occurred in immunosuppressed people."

It leads to an increased risk of bleeding. ITP manifests in two distinct clinical syndromes: an acute form observed in children and chronic conditions observed in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and typically resolves within two months while chronic immune thrombocytopenia persists for longer than six months and its specific cause is unknown. ITP is considered an autoimmune disease as antibodies against several platelet surface structures (antigens) can be detected.Diagnosis of ITP involves identifying a low platelet count through a complete blood count a common blood test. However since the diagnosis relies on excluding other potential causes of a low platelet count additional investigations such as a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in certain cases.For mild cases careful observation may be sufficient. However in instances of very low platelet counts or significant bleeding treatment options may include corticosteroids intravenous immunoglobulin anti-D immunoglobulin or immunosuppressive medications. Refractory ITP which does not respond to conventional treatment or shows constant relapse after splenectomy requires treatment to reduce the risk of significant bleeding. Platelet transfusions may be used in severe cases with extremely low platelet counts in individuals experiencing bleeding. In some cases the body may compensate by producing abnormally large platelets."

Psoriasis varies in severity from small localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.The five main types of psoriasis are plaque guttate inverse pustular and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis also known as psoriasis vulgaris makes up about 90% of cases. It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are the back of the forearms shins navel area and scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular psoriasis presents as small noninfectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis at some point in time. This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.Psoriasis is generally thought to be a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. If one twin has psoriasis the other twin is three times more likely to be affected if the twins are identical than if they are nonidentical. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.There is no known cure for psoriasis but various treatments can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams vitamin D3 cream ultraviolet light immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate and biologic therapies targeting specific immunologic pathways. About 75% of skin involvement improves with creams alone. The disease affects 2\u20134% of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of psoriatic arthritis lymphomas cardiovascular disease Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of individuals with psoriasis.The word \"psoriasis\" is from Greek \u03c8\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 meaning \"itching condition\" or \"being itchy\" from psora \"itch\" and -iasis \"action condition\"."

Like any surgical procedure it has risks; the endoscopic sympathetic block (ESB) procedure and those procedures that affect fewer nerves have lower risks.Sympathectomy physically destroys relevant nerves anywhere in either of the two sympathetic trunks which are long chains of nerve ganglia located bilaterally along the vertebral column (a localisation which entails a low risk of injury) responsible for various important aspects of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Each nerve trunk is broadly divided into three regions: cervical (neck) thoracic (chest) and lumbar (lower back). The most common area targeted in sympathectomy is the upper thoracic region that part of the sympathetic chain lying between the first and fifth thoracic vertebrae."

However in recent years experts in the field of the disorder believe it to be caused by an overactive sympathetic nervous system an automatic response which sufferers have no mental control over. It is related to focal hyperhidrosis more commonly known as excessive sweating as it is caused by the same overactive nerves which cause excessive sweating.

        "article": "Cutis verticis gyrata is a medical condition usually associated with thickening of the scalp. The condition is identified by excessive thickening of the soft tissues of the scalp and characterized by ridges and furrows which give the scalp a cerebriform appearance. Clinically the ridges are hard and cannot be flattened on applying pressure. Patients show visible folds ridges or creases on the surface of the top of the scalp. The number of folds can vary from two to roughly ten and they are typically soft and spongy. The condition typically affects the central and rear regions of the scalp but sometimes can involve the entire scalp.Hair loss can occur over time where the scalp thickens though hair within any furrows remains normal. Thus far due to the (apparent) rarity of the condition limited research exists and causes are as yet undetermined. What is known is that the condition is not exclusively congenital.The condition was first reported by Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert in 1837 who called it cutis sulcata. A clinical description of the condition was provided by Robert in 1843 and it was named by Paul Gerson Unna in 1907. It has also been called Robert-Unna syndrome bulldog scalp corrugated skin cutis verticis plicata and pachydermia verticis gyrata."

It is a type of melanocytic tumor that contains nevus cells. Some sources equate the term mole with \"melanocytic nevus\" but there are also sources that equate the term mole with any nevus form.The majority of moles appear during the first two decades of a person's life with about one in every 100 babies being born with moles. Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm while congenital moles or congenital nevi are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma. A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte. The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent melanin is responsible for their dark color. Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi occurring commonly in humans."

These melanocytes are distinct from the retinal pigment epithelium cells underlying the retina that do not form melanomas. When eye melanoma is spread to distant parts of the body the five-year survival rate is about 15%.It is the most common type of primary eye cancer. Males and females are affected equally.

Such reactions are called allergies.In technical terms an allergen is an antigen that is capable of stimulating a type-I hypersensitivity reaction in atopic individuals through immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses. Most humans mount significant Immunoglobulin E responses only as a defense against parasitic infections. However some individuals may respond to many common environmental antigens. This hereditary predisposition is called atopy. In atopic individuals non-parasitic antigens stimulate inappropriate IgE production leading to type I hypersensitivity.Sensitivities vary widely from one person (or from one animal) to another. A very broad range of substances can be allergens to sensitive individuals."

A dog that is repeatedly exposed to a particular allergen becomes sensitized to it and the immune system overreacts to a subsequent exposure most commonly manifesting in the form of skin irritation. Some of the signs are redness itching hair loss and recurring skin infections from the irritation.  Skin irritation may be generalized (all over) or localized (isolated to one or more specific areas).  The dog may be more prone to scratching and licking at the irritated site further exacerbating the problem. Other common signs of allergies include coughing sneezing wheezing ocular and nasal discharge vomiting diarrhea and licking of the paws.  While it may be possible to identify the cause of an allergic response it is best to seek attention from a veterinarian to identify the best treatment possible.  To identify the specific allergens to which the dog is sensitive veterinarians will commonly use a serum allergy test or a skin allergy test. Veterinarians may recommend either over the counter Benadryl without added decongestant or Zyrtec to alleviate clinical signs. If the allergy is more severe allergy immunotherapy may be recommended. There are a number of different kinds of allergies from which dogs may suffer. They may be gut-induced skin-induced and respiratory-induced."

These diseases include hay fever food allergies atopic dermatitis allergic asthma and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes an itchy rash sneezing coughing a runny nose shortness of breath or swelling. Note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.Common allergens include pollen and certain foods. Metals and other substances may also cause such problems. Food insect stings and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE) part of the body's immune system binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests however may not necessarily mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question.Early exposure of children to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoidance of known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear.Allergies are common. In the developed world about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis about 6% of people have at least one food allergy and about 20% have or have had atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country about 1\u201318% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05\u20132% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing.

Contact with damaged skin makes sensitization more likely. Medical implants may also cause allergic reactions. Diagnosis is by patch test a method which does not work as well for metals as it does for some other allergens.Prevention and treatment consists of avoiding the metal allergen; there is no other treatment as of 2021. It can be difficult to identify and avoid the allergen because many metals are common in the environment and some are biologically necessary to humans. Regulations have successfully reduced the rates of some metal allergies in Europe but are not widespread.

Like all allergies wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response.  Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat. Some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy is rare.  Prevalence in adults was found to be 0.21% in a 2012 study in Japan.  Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat for example serine protease inhibitors glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin-induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea urticaria and atopy.Gluten sensitivity and Coeliac disease are two different diseases even if the management could be similar. Management of wheat allergy consists of complete withdrawal of any food containing wheat or other gluten-containing cereals."

This is a fundamental concept studied in the field of developmental psychology the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.Jean Piaget the Swiss psychologist who first studied object permanence in infants argued that it is one of an infant's most important accomplishments as without this concept objects would have no separate permanent existence. In Piaget's theory of cognitive development infants develop this understanding by the end of the \"sensorimotor stage\" which lasts from birth to about two years of age. Piaget thought that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development which was required for the infant to link visual tactile and motor representations of objects. According to this view it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop object permanence."

The gametes of a parent result in a child a male through the sperm and a female through the ovum. Parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. Some parents may be adoptive parents who nurture and raise an offspring but are not biologically related to the child. Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members.A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation. With recent medical advances it is possible to have more than two biological parents. Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material.The most common types of parents are mothers fathers step-parents and grandparents. A mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth.\" The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective cosseting nosey or intrusive."

It is related to the larger eruption of K\u012blauea that began on January 3 1983 though some volcanologists and USGS scientists have discussed whether to classify it as a new eruption. Outbreaks of lava fountains up to 300 feet (90\u00a0m) high lava flows and volcanic gas in the Leilani Estates subdivision were preceded by earthquakes and ground deformation that created cracks in the roads.On May 4 a 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit Puna. By May 27 2018 24 fissures had erupted lava in and near the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions. The eruption forced the evacuation of approximately two thousand residents. The Puna Geothermal Venture which provided one-quarter of the island's electricity was forced to shut down and was later damaged by lava. The fissures had sent lava rivers that buried part of Hawaii Route 137 on May 19 and began flowing into the ocean.On May 29 lava from a new northeastern flow overran Hawaii Route 132 cutting the access between Kapoho and P\u0101hoa. The massive lava flow reached the Pacific Ocean at Kapoho Bay on June 4. Lava entered the Kapoho Crater and evaporated Green Lake which had been the largest natural freshwater lake in Hawai\u02bbi. On the night of June 4\u20135 the northeastern flow of lava speedily moved forward and destroyed the subdivision of Vacationland Hawaii. By June 5 Kapoho Bay had been filled in with lava now forming a point where the bay had been. The volcanic activity was the most destructive in the United States since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.By August 7 13.7 square miles (35\u00a0km2) of land had been covered by lava flows. About 875 acres (3.54\u00a0km2) of new land has been created in the ocean. The official number of houses destroyed by the eruption reached 700 on July 9. It was estimated that recovery efforts would cost more than $800 million (2018 USD). By early August the eruption had almost completely subsided and on December 5 it was declared to have ended after three months of inactivity."

As of 16 March 2024 there have been four eruptions between December 2023 and March 2024 following an intense series of earthquakes. Although localised the seismic and volcanic activity have caused significant disruption across the western part of the peninsula.The eruptions were preceded by an intense earthquake swarm in the Eldv\u00f6rp\u2013Svartsengi volcanic system that began on 24 October 2023 caused by a magmatic intrusion underneath the area. The frequency and intensity of the earthquakes dramatically increased on 10 November 2023 with 20000 tremors recorded by that time the largest of which exceeded magnitude 5.3. An evacuation was ordered in Grindav\u00edk and large-scale subsidence in and around the town caused significant damage.The first eruption started on the evening of 18 December 2023 at the Sundhn\u00fakur crater row north of Grindav\u00edk with lava spewing and spreading laterally from both sides of the 4\u00a0km-long (2.5\u00a0mi) fissures. The eruption was preceded by land uplift in the Svartsengi area which deflated upon eruption indicating magma accumulated in a storage area 4 to 5\u00a0km (2.5 to 3\u00a0mi) under Svartsengi feeding this and all subsequent eruptions at Sundhn\u00fakur. The eruption was described as the largest in the Reykjanes Peninsula since the beginning of eruptive activity in 2021.  The duration of the eruption however was relatively short with the intensity of the eruption subsiding early on 19 December and the eruption ended on 21 December.On 14 January 2024 a second fissure erupted north of Grindav\u00edk. A few hours later a smaller fissure opened less than 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) from the town inside the protection barriers with its lava reaching and burning down three residential houses. Just before the second eruption one individual was reported missing and presumed to have fallen into a crevice formed from the seismic activity and died. A third eruption began on 8 February 2024 in the same area as the December eruption with a fissure about 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) long effusively erupting lava on top of earlier flows. The lava flowed over a road and caused significant damage to utility infrastructure.A fourth eruption commenced on 16 March 2024 originating from a fissure approximately 3\u20134 kilometres (1.9\u20132.5\u00a0mi) in length. This event was considered more powerful than any preceding eruption on the peninsula since 2021 establishing it as the most significant in recent years. A magma intrusion previously occurred on 2 March but did not breach the surface potentially delaying the onset of the current eruption. This eruption lasted 54 days longer than the three that erupted since December."

Those only affected by a few worms may show no symptoms. Those infected by many worms may experience abdominal pain diarrhea weight loss and tiredness. The mental and physical development of children may be affected. Anemia may result.Two common hookworm infections in humans are ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis caused by the species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus respectively. Hookworm eggs are deposited in the stools of infected people. If these end up in the environment they can hatch into larvae (immature worms) which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope.The disease can be prevented on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common. At a population level decreasing outdoor defecation not using raw feces as fertilizer and mass deworming are effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.Hookworms infected about 428 million people in 2015. Heavy infections can occur in both children and adults but are less common in adults. They are rarely fatal. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and classified as a neglected tropical disease."

Aggressive lymphomas usually require intensive treatments with some having a good prospect for a permanent cure.Prognosis and treatment depends on the specific type of lymphoma as well as the stage and grade. Treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy. Early-stage indolent B-cell lymphomas can often be treated with radiation alone with long-term non-recurrence. Early-stage aggressive disease is treated with chemotherapy and often radiation with a 70\u201390% cure rate.

Later non-painful lymph node swelling feeling tired fever night sweats or weight loss for no clear reason may occur. Enlargement of the spleen and low red blood cells (anemia) may also occur. It typically worsens gradually over years.Risk factors include having a family history of the disease with 10% of those who develop CLL having such ancestry. Exposure to Agent Orange certain insecticides sun exposure exposure to hepatitis C virus and common infections are also considered risk factors. CLL results in the buildup of B cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow lymph nodes and blood. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:Those with a mutated IGHV geneThose without.Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests finding high numbers of mature lymphocytes and smudge cells.Early-stage CLL in asymptomatic cases responds better to careful observation as there is no evidence that early intervention treatment can alter the course of the disease. Immune defects occur early in the course of CLL and these increase the risk of developing serious infection which should be treated appropriately with antibiotics. In those with significant symptoms chemotherapy immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy may be used. Depending on the individual's age physical condition and whether they have the del(17p) or TP53 mutation different first line treatments may be offered. As of 2021 BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are often recommended for first line treatment of CLL. The medications fludarabine cyclophosphamide and rituximab were previously the initial treatment in those who are otherwise healthy.CLL affected about 904000 people globally in 2015 and resulted in 60700 deaths.  In 2021 the estimated incidence of CLL in the United States is 21250 new cases and 4320 deaths.  The disease most commonly occurs in people over the age of 65 due to the accumulation of genetic mutations that occur over time. Men are diagnosed around twice as often as women (6.8 to 3.5 ratio). It is much less common in people from Asia. Five-year survival following diagnosis is approximately 83% in the United States. It represents less than 1% of deaths from cancer."

It is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults with an annual incidence of 7\u20138 cases per 100000 people per year in the US and UK. This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals with a median age of diagnosis at ~70 years although it can occur in young adults and in rare cases children. DLBCL can arise in virtually any part of the body and depending on various factors is often a very aggressive malignancy. The first sign of this illness is typically the observation of a rapidly growing mass or tissue infiltration that is sometimes associated with systemic B symptoms e.g. fever weight loss and night sweats.The causes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not well understood. Usually DLBCL arises from normal B cells but it can also represent a malignant transformation of other types of lymphoma (particularly marginal zone lymphomas) or in rare cases termed Richter's transformation chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An underlying immunodeficiency is a significant risk factor for development of the disease. Infections with the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus human immunodeficiency virus (i.e. HIV) and the Helicobacter pylori bacterium are also associated with the development of certain subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However most cases of this disease are associated with the unexplained step-wise acquisition of increasing numbers of gene mutations and changes in gene expression that occur in and progressively promote the malignant behavior of certain B-cell types.Diagnosis of DLBCL is made by removing a portion of the tumor through a biopsy and then examining this tissue using a microscope. Usually a hematopathologist makes this diagnosis. Numerous subtypes of DLBCL have been identified which differ in their clinical presentations biopsy findings aggressive characteristics prognoses and recommended treatments. However the usual treatment for most subtypes of DLBCL is chemotherapy combined with a monoclonal antibody drug that targets the disease's cancerous B-cells usually rituximab. Through these treatments more than half of all patients with DLBCL can be cured; the overall cure rate for older adults is less than this but their five-year survival rate has been around 58%."

The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes fever drenching sweats unintended weight loss itching and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night.Many subtypes of lymphomas are known. The two main categories of lymphomas are the non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (90% of cases) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (10%).  Lymphomas leukemias and myelomas are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases HIV/AIDS infection with human T-lymphotropic virus immunosuppressant medications and some pesticides. In 2014 the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated its classification of trichloroethylene to Group 1 indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it causes cancer of the kidney in humans as well as some evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis if enlarged lymph nodes are present is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood urine and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs liver and brain.Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy radiation therapy proton therapy targeted therapy and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States for all Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes is 85% while that for non-Hodgkin lymphomas is 69%. Worldwide lymphomas developed in 566000 people in 2012 and caused 305000 deaths. They make up 3\u20134% of all cancers making them as a group the seventh-most common form. In children they are the third-most common cancer. They occur more often in the developed world than the developing world."

Marginal zone B cells are innate lymphoid cells that normally function by rapidly mounting IgM antibody immune responses to antigens such as those presented by infectious agents and damaged tissues. They are lymphocytes of the B-cell line that originate and mature in secondary lymphoid follicles and then move to the marginal zones of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) the spleen or lymph nodes. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is a diffuse system of small concentrations of lymphoid tissue found in various submucosal membrane sites of the body such as the gastrointestinal tract mouth nasal cavity pharynx thyroid gland breast lung salivary glands eye skin and the human spleen.In 2016 the World Health Organization classified MZLs into three different types. Extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (EMZLs) are MZLs that develop in extranodal tissues. Most EMZLs develop in MALT and are often termed extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue or more simply MALT lymphomas. Splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZLs) are MZLs that initially are confined to the spleen bone marrow and blood. Nodal marginal zone lymphomas (NMZs) are MZLs initially confined to lymph nodes bone marrow and blood.  While all of these MZL involve malignant B-cells they differ not only in the tissues they involve but also in their pathophysiology clinical presentations prognoses and treatments.MZLs represent 5\u201317% of all Non-Hodgkin lymphomas with the extranodal splenic and nodal forms accounting for 50\u201370% ~20% and ~10% of all MZLs. The three MZL subtypes occur more often in older people (age 65\u201368 years) and are indolent diseases that may in people without symptoms be initially treated by a watchful waiting strategy. However NMZL carries a somewhat worse long term outcome than the other subtypes and any of the MZL subtypes may progress in a low percentage of cases to a more aggressive lymphoma particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. One of the most distinctive feature of MZL is that many cases are associated with the persistent simulation of the immune system by the chronic inflammation that accompanies infections or autoimmune diseases. MZL cases associated with certain infectious pathogens can be cured by treatment directed at the pathogens causing or associated with these infections."

        "article": "Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type (PCDLBCL-LT) (also termed PCDLBCL leg type or primary cutaneous DLBCL leg type) is a cutaneous lymphoma skin disease that occurs mostly in elderly females. In this disease B cells (a type of lymphocyte) become malignant accumulate in the dermis (i.e. the layer under the epidermis) and subcutaneous tissue below the dermis to form red and violaceous skin nodules and tumors. These lesions typically occur on the lower extremities but in uncommon cases may develop on the skin at virtually any other site. In ~10% of cases the disease presents with one or more skin lesions none of which are on the lower extremities; the disease in these cases is sometimes regarded as a variant of PCDLBL LT termed primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma other (PCDLBC-O). PCDLBCL LT is a subtype of the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and has been thought of as a cutaneous counterpart to them. Like most variants and subtypes of the DLBCL PCDLBCL LT is an aggressive malignancy. It has a 5-year overall survival rate of 40\u201355% although the PCDLBCL-O variant has a better prognosis than cases in which the legs are involved.Most lymphomas begin in a lymph node mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue the spleen or another lymphoid tissue within the lymphatic system and then may spread to the skin. In these cases the skin is a secondarily site of involvement. PCDLBC LT is a primary cutaneous lymphoma i.e. it begins in the skin and then may spread to lymphoid and/or non-lymphoid tissues in virtually any other site. A suspect PCDLBCL LT that is not limited to the skin at the time of diagnosis should be regarded as some other variant or subtype of the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.PCDLBC LT represents 5\u201310% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. It is to be distinguished from two other primary cutaneous lymphomas that involve B-cells primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma  (PCFCL) and primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) as well as from a B-cell lymphoma that at diagnosis may appear to be limited to the skin but often is a systemic disease affecting numerous organs and tissues viz. intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL). These three B-cell lymphomas differ from PCDLBCL LT in numerous ways but most importantly in their aggressiveness. IVLEBC is like PCDLBCL LT an aggressive disease with a guarded prognosis but unlike the former disease is often widely disseminated at presentation. PCFCL and PCMZL in contrast are indolent lymphomas with a relatively good prognosis. Distinguishing between these four cutaneous B-cell lymphomas at the time of diagnosis is critical for their appropriate treatment."

Lymphoma arises mainly from the uncontrolled proliferation of T-cells and can become cancerous.T-cell lymphoma is categorized under Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and represents less than 15% of all Non-Hodgkin's diseases in the category. T-cell lymphomas are often categorised based on their growth patterns as either; aggressive (fast-growing) or indolent (slow-growing). Although the cause of T-cell lymphoma is not definitive it has been associated with various risk factors and viruses such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV1).The prognosis and treatment of T-cell lymphoma can vary drastically based on the specific type of lymphoma and its growth patterns. Due to their rarity and high variability between the different subtypes the prognosis of T-cell lymphoma is significantly worse than other Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment of T-cell lymphoma is often similar to other Non-Hodgkin lymphomas with early-stage treatments consisting of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The effectiveness of these treatments is often varied between subtypes with most receiving a poor outcome with high relapse rates."

The name is derived from the Greek word \"toxon\" meaning bow or quiver and the Latin word \"caro\" meaning flesh.  T. canis live in the small intestine of the definitive host. This parasite is very common in puppies and somewhat less common in adult dogs. In adult dogs infection is usually asymptomatic but may be characterized by diarrhea. By contrast untreated infection with Toxocara canis can be fatal in puppies causing diarrhea vomiting pneumonia enlarged abdomen flatulence poor growth rate and other complications.As paratenic hosts a number of vertebrates including humans and some invertebrates can become infected. Humans are infected like other paratenic hosts by ingestion of embryonated T. canis eggs. The disease (toxocariasis) caused by migrating T. canis larvae results in two syndromes: visceral larva migrans and ocular larva migrans. Owing to transmission of the infection from the mother to her puppies preventive anthelmintic treatment of newborn puppies is strongly recommended. Several anthelmintic drugs are effective against adult worms for example fenbendazole milbemycin moxidectin piperazine pyrantel and selamectin."

Nematodes causing such zoonotic infections are Baylisascaris procyonis Toxocara canis Toxocara cati and Ascaris suum.  These nematodes can infect but not mature in humans and after migrating through the intestinal wall travel with the blood stream to various organs where they cause inflammation and damage. Affected organs can include the liver heart (causing myocarditis) and the CNS (causing dysfunction seizures and coma). A special variant is ocular larva migrans where usually T. canis larvae travel to the eye.Only a few roundworm eggs are necessary to cause larva migrans in the human child or adult.  However visceral larva migrans seems to affect children aged 1\u20134 more often while ocular larva migrans more frequently affects children aged 7\u20138.  Between 4.6% and 23% of U.S. children have been infected with the dog roundworm egg.

        "article": "Lupus technically known as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary among people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints fever chest pain hair loss mouth ulcers swollen lymph nodes feeling tired and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness called flares and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.The cause of SLE is not clear. It is thought to involve a combination of genetics and environmental factors. Among identical twins if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will also develop the disease. Female sex hormones sunlight smoking vitamin D deficiency and certain infections are also believed to increase a person's risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus neonatal lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.There is no cure for SLE but there are experimental and symptomatic treatments. Treatments may include NSAIDs corticosteroids immunosuppressants hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Although corticosteroids are rapidly effective long-term use results in side effects. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Men have higher mortality. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. While women with lupus have higher risk pregnancies most are successful.Rate of SLE varies between countries from 20 to 70 per 100000. Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. While it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45 a wide range of ages can be affected. Those of African Caribbean and Chinese descent are at higher risk than those of European descent. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear. Lupus is Latin for \"wolf\": the disease was so-named in the 13th century as the rash was thought to appear like a wolf's bite."

The term connotes especially difficult differential diagnosis (DDx) especial potential for misdiagnosis and the protean nature of some diseases. Most great imitators are systemic in nature or have systemic sequelae and an aspect of nonspecific symptoms is logically almost always involved. In some cases an assumption that a particular sign or symptom or a particular pattern of several thereof is pathognomonic turns out to be false as the reality is that it is only nearly so. As recently as the 1950s syphilis was widely considered by physicians to be \"the great imitator\" and in the next few decades after that several other candidates mainly tuberculosis but occasionally others were asserted as being \"the second great imitator\". But because differential diagnosis is inherently subject to occasional difficulty and to false positives and false negatives the idea that there are only one or two great imitators was more melodrama than objective description. In recent decades more than a dozen diseases have been recognized in the medical literature as worthy of being considered great imitators on the common theme of recurring misdiagnoses/missed diagnoses and protean manifestations. Nonetheless not every DDx caveat (not every mimic) meets the threshold because it is inherent to DDx generally that there are thousands of caveats (thousands of instances of the theme \"be careful to rule out X before diagnosing Y\"); for example ectopic pregnancy and ovarian neoplasia can mimic each other as can myocardial infarction and panic attack but they are not established as great imitators per se (rather merely DDx considerations). The list of great imitators here relies on references in the medical literature applying that label or on other references documenting a condition's especially recurrent and poignant reputation for misdiagnoses. Conditions or diseases sometimes referred to with this nickname thus include the following:"

Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. Around 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which if left untreated kill about half of those affected. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus fever night sweats and weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.Tuberculosis is spread from one person to the next through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough spit speak or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk early detection and treatment of cases and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine. Those at high risk include household workplace and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).In 2018 one quarter of the world's population was thought to have a latent infection of TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2022 an estimated 10.6\u00a0million people developed active TB resulting in 1.3\u00a0million deaths making it the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease after COVID-19. As of 2018 most TB cases occurred in the regions of South-East Asia (44%) Africa (24%) and the Western Pacific (18%) with more than 50% of cases being diagnosed in seven countries: India (27%) China (9%) Indonesia (8%) the Philippines (6%) Pakistan (6%) Nigeria (4%) and Bangladesh (4%). By 2021 the number of new cases each year was decreasing by around 2% annually. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5\u201310% of people in the United States test positive via the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times."

During this initial period Isoniazid is taken alongside pyridoxal phosphate to obviate peripheral neuropathy. Isoniazid is then taken concurrently with rifampicin for the remaining four months of treatment (6-8 months for Miliary Tuberculosis). A patient is expected to be free from all living TB bacteria after six months of therapy in Pulmonary TB or 8-10 months in Miliary TB.Latent tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is treated with three to nine months of isoniazid alone. This long-term treatment often risks the development of hepatotoxicity. A combination of isoniazid plus rifampicin for a period of three to four months is shown to be an equally effective method for treating LTBI while mitigating risks to hepatotoxicity.

Symptoms often include abdominal pain diarrhea fever abdominal distension and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia skin rashes arthritis inflammation of the eye and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer.Although the precise causes of Crohn's disease (CD) are unknown it is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental immune and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder in which the body's immune system defends the gastrointestinal tract possibly targeting microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an immune-related disease it does not seem to be an autoimmune disease (the immune system is not triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however it may be an immunodeficiency state.About half of the overall risk is related to genetics with more than 70 genes involved. Tobacco smokers are three times as likely to develop Crohn's disease as non-smokers. It often begins after gastroenteritis. Other conditions with similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome and Beh\u00e7et's disease.There is no known cure for Crohn's disease. Treatment options are intended to help with symptoms maintain remission and prevent relapse. In those newly diagnosed a corticosteroid may be used for a brief period of time to improve symptoms rapidly alongside another medication such as either methotrexate or a thiopurine used to prevent recurrence. Cessation of smoking is recommended for people with Crohn's disease. One in five people with the disease is admitted to the hospital each year and half of those with the disease will require surgery at some time during a ten-year period. While surgery should be used as little as possible it is necessary to address some abscesses certain bowel obstructions and cancers. Checking for bowel cancer via colonoscopy is recommended every few years starting eight years after the disease has begun.Crohn's disease affects about 3.2 per 1000 people in Europe and North America; it is less common in Asia and Africa. It has historically been more common in the developed world. Rates have however been increasing particularly in the developing world since the 1970s. Inflammatory bowel disease resulted in 47400 deaths in 2015 and those with Crohn's disease have a slightly reduced life expectancy. It tends to start in adolescence and young adulthood though it can occur at any age. Males and females are equally affected."

This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister on the hands feet and mouth and occasionally buttocks and groin. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3\u20136 days after exposure to the virus. The rash generally resolves on its own in about a week. Fingernail and toenail loss may occur a few weeks later but they will regrow with time.The viruses that cause HFMD are spread through close personal contact through the air from coughing and the feces of an infected person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause and enterovirus 71 is the second-most common cause. Other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. Other animals are not involved. Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. Occasionally a throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus.Most people with hand foot and mouth disease get better on their own in 7 to 10 days. Most cases require no specific treatment. No antiviral medication or vaccine is available but development efforts are underway. For fever and for painful mouth sores over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used though aspirin should be avoided in children. The illness is usually not serious. Occasionally intravenous fluids are given to children who are dehydrated. Very rarely viral meningitis or encephalitis may complicate the disease. Because HFMD is normally mild some jurisdictions allow children to continue to go to child care and schools as long as they have no fever or uncontrolled drooling with mouth sores and as long as they feel well enough to participate in classroom activities.HFMD occurs in all areas of the world. It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens. Large outbreaks have been occurring in Asia since 1997. It usually occurs during the spring summer and fall months. Typically it occurs in children less than five years old but can occasionally occur in adults. HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also known as hoof-and-mouth disease) which mostly affects livestock."

Noma usually begins as an ulcer on gums and rapidly spreads into the jawbone cheek and soft tissues of the face. This is followed by death of the facial tissues and fatal sepsis. Survivors are  left with severe facial disfigurement often with impairments in breathing swallowing speaking and vision. In 2023 noma was added to the World Health Organization's list of neglected tropical diseases.This disease is strongly linked to poverty and malnutrition and predominantly affects children between the ages of two and six years in the least developed countries around the world primarily in sub-Saharan Africa; noma has also been seen in severely immunocompromised people in the developed world. It is preventable by proper nutrition and oral hygiene. Noma is most common in impoverished environments with poor healthcare infrastructure; as a result many cases go undiagnosed untreated and unreported. There are no reliable estimates of its prevalence - in 1998 WHO estimated that there were 140 000 cases per year with a fatality rate of 90%; no more recent estimates are available.Noma is an opportunistic infection linked to a number of microbes which take advantage by malnutrition and compromised immunity. There is no evidence of direct transmission from person to person. In the early stages it can be treated effectively with antibiotics and nutrition supplements. If diagnosed early enough there can be proper wound healing. After recovering patients with disfigurement require complex surgical rehabilitation.Noma survivors experience high levels of stigma social isolation and discrimination within their communities. These can be countered by education and community outreach programmes."

In its more serious form called periodontitis the gums can pull away from the tooth bone can be lost and the teeth may loosen or fall out. Halitosis (bad breath) may also occur.Periodontal disease is generally due to bacteria in the mouth infecting the tissue around the teeth. Factors that increase the risk of disease include smoking diabetes HIV/AIDS family history high levels of homocysteine in the blood and certain medications. Diagnosis is by inspecting the gum tissue around the teeth both visually and with a probe and X-rays looking for bone loss around the teeth.Treatment involves good oral hygiene and regular professional teeth cleaning. Recommended oral hygiene include daily brushing and flossing. In certain cases antibiotics or dental surgery may be recommended. Clinical investigations demonstrate that quitting smoking and making dietary changes enhance periodontal health.

These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At onset there are usually no symptoms but if they develop symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases it can result in coronary artery disease stroke peripheral artery disease or kidney disorders depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body.The exact cause of atherosclerosis is unknown and is proposed to be multifactorial. Risk factors include abnormal cholesterol levels elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers high blood pressure diabetes smoking (both active and passive smoking) obesity genetic factors family history lifestyle habits and an unhealthy diet. Plaque is made up of fat cholesterol calcium and other substances found in the blood. The narrowing of arteries limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to parts of the body. Diagnosis is based upon a physical exam electrocardiogram and exercise stress test among others.Prevention guidelines include eating a healthy diet exercising not smoking and maintaining normal body weight. Treatment of established disease may include medications to lower cholesterol such as statins blood pressure medication and anticoagulant therapies to reduce the risk of blood clot formation. As the disease state progresses more invasive strategies are applied such as percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass graft or carotid endarterectomy. Genetic factors are also strongly implicated in the disease process; it is not entirely based on lifestyle choices.Atherosclerosis generally starts when a person is young and worsens with age. Almost all people are affected to some degree by the age of 65. It is the number one cause of death and disability in developed countries. Though it was first described in 1575 there is evidence suggesting that this disease state is genetically inherent in the broader human population with its origins tracing back to genetic mutations that may have occurred more than two million years ago during the evolution of hominin ancestors of modern human beings."

It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths. Coronary artery disease stroke and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis. This may be caused by high blood pressure smoking diabetes mellitus lack of exercise obesity high blood cholesterol poor diet excessive alcohol consumption  and poor sleep among other things. High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths while tobacco accounts for 9% diabetes 6% lack of exercise 6% and obesity 5%. Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat.It is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable. Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through: healthy eating exercise avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake. Treating risk factors such as high blood pressure blood lipids and diabetes is also beneficial. Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease. The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015 up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990.

Most individuals develop symptoms between the ages of 20\u201350; however cases outside of this age range have been reported as well."

While there are several definitions of hypertensive heart disease in the medical literature the term is most widely used in the context of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding categories. The definition includes heart failure and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is stated or implied on the death certificate. In 2013 hypertensive heart disease resulted in 1.07 million deaths as compared with 630000 deaths in 1990.According to ICD-10 hypertensive heart disease (I11) and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I05-I09)  other forms of heart disease (I30-I52) and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25). However since high blood pressure is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease death rates from hypertensive heart disease provide an incomplete measure of the burden of disease due to high blood pressure."

        "article": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a vascular disorder that causes abnormal narrowing of arteries other than those that supply the heart or brain. PAD can happen in any blood vessel but it is more common in the legs than the arms.When narrowing occurs in the heart it is called coronary artery disease (CAD) and in the brain it is called cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs but other arteries may also be involved such as those of the arms neck or kidneys.Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a form of peripheral vascular disease. Vascular refers to both the arteries and veins within the body. PAD differs from peripheral veinous disease. PAD means the arteries are narrowed or blocked\u2014the vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood as it moves away from the heart to other parts of the body. Peripheral veinous disease on the other hand refers to problems with veins\u2014the vessels that bring the blood back to the heart.The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest and is known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms include skin ulcers bluish skin cold skin or abnormal nail and hair growth in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation; coronary artery disease; or stroke. Up to 50% of people with PAD do not have symptoms.The greatest risk factor for PAD is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes high blood pressure kidney problems and high blood cholesterol. PAD is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries which is called atherosclerosis especially in individuals over 40 years old. Other mechanisms include artery spasm blood clots trauma fibromuscular dysplasia and vasculitis. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90 which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however it is associated with greater risks.It is unclear if screening for peripheral artery disease in people without symptoms is useful as it has not been properly studied. For those with intermittent claudication from PAD stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy may improve outcomes. Medications including statins ACE inhibitors and cilostazol may also help. Aspirin which helps with thinning the blood and thus improving blood flow does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended for those with more significant disease due to the increased risk of heart attacks. Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin show no definitive scientific evidence of benefit in PAD. Surgical procedures used to treat PAD include bypass grafting angioplasty and atherectomy.In 2015 about 155 million people had PAD worldwide. It becomes more common with age. In the developed world it affects about 5.3% of 45- to 50-year-olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the developing world it affects 4.6% of people between the ages of 45 and 50 and 15% of people between the ages of 85 and 90. PAD in the developed world is equally common among men and women though in the developing world women are more commonly affected. In 2015 PAD resulted in about 52500 deaths which is an increase from the 16000 deaths in 1990."

Morgellons is considered to be a subtype of this condition in which individuals have sores that they believe contain harmful fibers.Delusional parasitosis is classified as a delusional disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5). The cause is unknown but is thought to be related to excess dopamine in the brain.  Delusional parasitosis is diagnosed when the delusion is the only symptom of psychosis and the delusion\u2014that cannot be better explained by another condition\u2014has lasted a month or longer. Few individuals with the condition willingly accept treatment because they do not recognize the illness as a delusion. Antipsychotic medications offer a potential cure while cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants can be used to help alleviate symptoms.The condition is rare and is observed twice as often in women as men. The average age of people with the disorder is 57. An alternative name Ekbom's syndrome honors the neurologist Karl-Axel Ekbom who published seminal accounts of the disease in 1937 and 1938."

Leitao and others involved in her Morgellons Research Foundation successfully lobbied members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the condition in 2006. CDC researchers issued the results of their multi-year study in January 2012 indicating that no disease organisms were present in the samples from the individuals examined and that the fibers found were likely cotton.

        "article": "Coeliac disease (British English) or celiac disease (American English) is a long-term autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine where individuals develop intolerance to gluten present in foods such as wheat rye and barley. Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea abdominal distention malabsorption loss of appetite and among children failure to grow normally. Non-classic symptoms are more common especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body or no obvious symptoms. Coeliac disease was first described in childhood; however it may develop at any age. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto's thyroiditis among others.Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten a group of various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley and rye. Moderate quantities of oats free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains are usually tolerated. The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat. It occurs more often in people who are genetically predisposed. Upon exposure to gluten an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs. In the small bowel this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine (villous atrophy). This affects the absorption of nutrients frequently leading to anaemia.Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies helped by specific genetic testing. Making the diagnosis is not always straightforward. About 10% of the time the autoantibodies in the blood are negative and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi. People may have severe symptoms and they may be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved. As a result of screening the diagnosis is increasingly being made in people who have no symptoms. Evidence regarding the effects of screening however is not sufficient to determine its usefulness. While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins it is distinct from wheat allergy which is much more rare.The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet which leads to recovery of the intestinal lining (mucous membrane) improves symptoms and reduces the risk of developing complications in most people. If untreated it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma and a slightly increased risk of early death. Rates vary between different regions of the world from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40 with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people. It is estimated that 80% of cases remain undiagnosed usually because of minimal or absent gastrointestinal complaints and lack of knowledge of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men."

The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.Gluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders including coeliac disease (CD) non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) gluten ataxia dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and wheat allergy. In these people the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten. People with a poor understanding of a gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet but are making regular errors.In addition a gluten-free diet may in at least some cases improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome rheumatoid arthritis or HIV enteropathy among others. There is no good evidence that gluten-free diets are an alternative medical treatment for people with autism.Gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not as enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.A gluten-free diet may be based on gluten-free foods such as meat fish eggs milk and dairy products legumes nuts fruits vegetables potatoes rice and corn. Gluten-free processed foods may be used. Pseudocereals (quinoa amaranth and buckwheat) and some minor cereals have been labelled commercially as alternative choices but have since been found to be problematic among gluten intolerant and coeliac individuals depending on the quantity consumed."

The increase might be explained by the popularity of the Western diet the expanded reach of the Mediterranean diet (which also includes grains with gluten) the growing replacement of rice by wheat in many countries the development in recent years of new types of wheat with a higher amount of cytotoxic gluten peptides and the higher content of gluten in bread and bakery products due to the reduction of dough fermentation time. However a 2020 study by the Leibniz-Institute for Food Systems Biology casts doubt on the idea that modern wheat has higher gluten levels. From a seed bank they grew and analyzed 60 wheat cultivars from between 1891 and 2010 and found no changes in albumin/globulin and gluten contents over time. \"Overall the harvest year had a more significant effect on protein composition than the cultivar.

Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.7\u00a0million hectares or 545\u00a0million acres in 2021). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. In 2021 world wheat production was 771\u00a0million tonnes (850\u00a0million short tons) making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (known as corn in the US and Australia; wheat is often called corn in other countries). Since 1960 world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing because of the usefulness of gluten to the food industry.Wheat is an important source of  carbohydrates. Globally it is the leading source of vegetable proteins in human food having a protein content of about 13% which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality (supplying essential amino acids). When eaten as the whole grain wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.

The estimated cumulative ten-year survival rate for patients with different antisyntetase antibodies is 76.8%.Antisynthetase syndrome is estimated by Orphanet to affect 1-3 people per 100000 worldwide; however precise data on the disease's prevalence is not available. Antisynthetase syndrome is more common in women."

These may occur suddenly or develop over months. Other symptoms may include weight loss fever lung inflammation or light sensitivity. Complications may include calcium deposits in muscles or skin.The cause is unknown. Theories include that it is an autoimmune disease or a result of a viral infection. Dermatomyositis may develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with several forms of malignancy. It is a type of inflammatory myopathy. Diagnosis is typically based on some combination of symptoms blood tests electromyography and muscle biopsies.Eighty percent of adults with adult-onset dermatomyositis have a myositis-specific antibody (MSA).Sixty percent of children with juvenile dermatomyositis have a myositis-specific antibody (MSA).Although no cure for the condition is known treatments generally improve symptoms. Treatments may include medication physical therapy exercise heat therapy orthotics and assistive devices and rest. Medications in the corticosteroids family are typically used with other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine recommended if steroids are not working well. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also improve outcomes. Most people improve with treatment and in some the condition resolves completely.About one per 100000 people per year are newly affected. The condition usually occurs in those in their 40s and 50s with women being affected more often than men. People of any age however may be affected. The condition was first described in the 1800s."

        "article": "In medicine myopathy is a disease of the muscle in which the muscle fibers do not function properly. Myopathy means muscle disease (Greek\u00a0: myo- muscle + patheia -pathy\u00a0: suffering). This meaning implies that the primary defect is within the muscle as opposed to the nerves (\"neuropathies\" or \"neurogenic\" disorders) or elsewhere (e.g. the brain). This muscular defect typically results in myalgia (muscle pain) muscle weakness (reduced muscle force) or premature muscle fatigue (initially normal but declining muscle force). Muscle cramps stiffness spasm and contracture can also be associated with myopathy. Myopathy experienced over a long period (chronic) may result in the muscle becoming an abnormal size such as muscle atrophy (abnormally small) or a pseudoathletic appearance (abnormally large).Capture myopathy can occur in wild or captive animals such as deer and kangaroos and leads to morbidity and mortality. It usually occurs as a result of stress and physical exertion during capture and restraint.Muscular disease can be classified as neuromuscular or musculoskeletal in nature. Some conditions such as myositis can be considered both neuromuscular and musculoskeletal. Different myopathies may be inherited infectious non-communicable or idiopathic (cause unknown). The disease may be isolated to affecting only muscle (pure myopathy) or may be part of a systemic disease as is typical in mitochondrial myopathies."

The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed. The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling. Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles with carbuncles being larger. A cyst is related to an abscess but it contains a material other than pus and a cyst has a clearly defined wall.They are usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In many areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.Standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage. There appears to be some benefit from also using antibiotics. A small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with gauze after drainage. Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning. Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient.Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as 65% among users. In 2005 3.2 million people went to American emergency departments for abscesses. In Australia around 13000 people were hospitalized in 2008 with the condition."

Signs and symptoms include an area of redness which increases in size over a few days. The borders of the area of redness are generally not sharp and the skin may be swollen. While the redness often turns white when pressure is applied this is not always the case. The area of infection is usually painful. Lymphatic vessels may occasionally be involved and the person may have a fever and feel tired.The legs and face are the most common sites involved although cellulitis can occur on any part of the body. The leg is typically affected following a break in the skin. Other risk factors include obesity leg swelling and old age. For facial infections a break in the skin beforehand is not usually the case. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to cellulitis erysipelas is a bacterial infection involving the more superficial layers of the skin present with an area of redness with well-defined edges and more often is associated with a fever. The diagnosis is usually based on the presenting signs and symptoms while a cell culture is rarely possible. Before making a diagnosis more serious infections such as an underlying bone infection or necrotizing fasciitis should be ruled out.Treatment is typically with antibiotics taken by mouth such as cephalexin amoxicillin or cloxacillin. Those who are allergic to penicillin may be prescribed erythromycin or clindamycin instead. When methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a concern doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may in addition be recommended. There is concern related to the presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the infected area may be useful as may pain killers.Potential complications include abscess formation. Around 95% of people are better after 7 to 10 days of treatment. Those with diabetes however often have worse outcomes. Cellulitis occurred in about 21.2 million people in 2015. In the United States about 2 of every 1000 people per year have a case affecting the lower leg. Cellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16900 deaths worldwide. In the United Kingdom cellulitis was the reason for 1.6% of admissions to a hospital."

        "article": "Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) also termed drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) is a rare reaction to certain medications. It involves primarily a widespread skin rash fever swollen lymph nodes and characteristic blood abnormalities such as an abnormally high level of eosinophils low number of platelets and increased number of atypical white blood cells (lymphocytes). However DRESS is often complicated by potentially life-threatening inflammation of internal organs and the syndrome has about a 10% mortality rate. Treatment consists of stopping the offending medication and providing supportive care. Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used as well but no controlled clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of this treatment.DRESS is classified as one form of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). In addition to DRESS SCARs includes four other drug-induced skin reactions: the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Stevens\u2013Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap syndrome (SJS/TEN) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). The SCARs disorders have similar disease mechanisms. New strategies are in use or development to screen individuals at risk for DRESS to aid them in avoiding medications that increase the risk of DRESS. Alternative medications are used in all individuals testing positive for these predispositions.Prior to 1996 there were numerous reports on individuals presenting with a medication-induced disorder now recognized as the DRESS syndrome. For example anticonvulsants in the 1930s phenytoin in 1950 and other medications in the ensuing years were reported to do so. The reports often named the disorder based on the medication evoking it e.g. the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome. In 1996 however the term DRESS syndrome was coined in a report attempting to simplify the terminology and consolidate these various clearly related syndromes into a single underlying disorder."

Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens\u2013Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) overlap they are considered febrile mucocutaneous drug reactions and probably part of the same spectrum of disease with SJS being less severe. Erythema multiforme (EM) is generally considered a separate condition. Early symptoms of SJS include fever and flu-like symptoms. A few days later the skin begins to blister and peel forming painful raw areas. Mucous membranes such as the mouth are also typically involved. Complications include dehydration sepsis pneumonia and multiple organ failure.The most common cause is certain medications such as lamotrigine carbamazepine allopurinol sulfonamide antibiotics and nevirapine. Other causes can include infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus or the cause may remain unknown. Risk factors include HIV/AIDS and systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnosis of Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome is based on involvement of less than 10% of the skin. It is known as TEN when more than 30% of the skin is involved and considered an intermediate form when 10\u201330% is involved. SJS/TEN reactions are believed to follow a type IV hypersensitivity mechanism. It is also included with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and toxic epidermal necrolysis in a group of conditions known severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs).Treatment typically takes place in hospital such as in a burn unit or intensive care unit. Efforts may include stopping the cause pain medication antihistamines antibiotics intravenous immunoglobulins or corticosteroids. Together with TEN SJS affects 1 to 2 people per million per year. Typical onset is under the age of 30. Skin usually regrows over two to three weeks; however complete recovery can take months. Overall the risk of death with SJS is 5 to 10%."

Irritation also has non-clinical usages referring to bothersome physical or psychological pain or discomfort.Irritation can also be induced by some allergic response due to exposure of some allergens for example contact dermatitis irritation of mucosal membranes and pruritus. Mucosal membrane is the most common site of irritation because it contains secretory glands that release mucous which attracts the allergens due to its sticky nature.Chronic irritation is a medical term signifying that afflictive health conditions have been present for a while. There are many disorders that can cause chronic irritation the majority involve the skin vagina eyes and lungs."

        "article": "Skin is the layer of usually soft flexible outer tissue covering the body of a vertebrate animal with three main functions: protection regulation and sensation.Other animal coverings such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \"of the skin\" (from Latin cutis 'skin'). In mammals the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles bones ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians reptiles and birds. Skin (including cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues) plays crucial roles in formation structure and function of extraskeletal apparatus such as horns of bovids (e.g. cattle) and rhinos cervids' antlers giraffids' ossicones armadillos' osteoderm and os penis/os clitoris.All mammals have some hair on their skin even marine mammals like whales dolphins and porpoises that appear to be hairless.The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation temperature regulation sensation and the production of vitamin D folates.  Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin on the body at 0.5\u00a0mm thick and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \"crows feet\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is the thickest skin on the body at 4\u00a0mm thick. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by estrogen.Fur is dense hair. Primarily fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. On some animals the skin is very hard and thick and can be processed to create leather. Reptiles and most fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection and birds have hard feathers all made of tough beta-keratins. Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. For example a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly as the chemical diffuses through its skin. Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.On 11 January 2024 biologists reported the discovery of the oldest known skin fossilized about 289 million years ago and possibly the skin from an ancient reptile."

Blisters occur with minor trauma or friction and are painful. Its severity can range from mild to fatal. Inherited EB is a rare disease with a prevalence in the United States of 8.2 per million live births. Those with mild cases may not develop symptoms until they start to crawl or walk. Complications may include esophageal narrowing squamous cell skin cancer and the need for amputations.EB is due to a mutation in at least one of 16 different genes. Some types are autosomal dominant while others are autosomal recessive. The underlying mechanism is a defect in attachment between or within the layers of the skin. Loss or diminished function of type VII collagen leads to weakness in the structural architecture of the dermal\u2013epidermal junction (DEJ) and mucosal membranes. There are four main types: epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) and Kindler syndrome. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by skin biopsy or genetic testing.There is no cure for the condition. Management involves wound care pain control controlling infections nutritional support and prevention and treatment of complications. About half a million people are affected globally.

The first therapeutic use of gene transfer as well as the first direct insertion of human DNA into the nuclear genome was performed by French Anderson in a trial starting in September 1990. Between 1989 and December 2018 over 2900 clinical trials were conducted with more than half of them in phase I. In 2003 Gendicine became the first gene therapy to receive regulatory approval. Since that time further gene therapy drugs were approved such as Glybera (2012) Strimvelis (2016) Kymriah (2017) Luxturna (2017) Onpattro (2018) Zolgensma (2019) Abecma (2021) Adstiladrin Roctavian and Hemgenix (all 2022).

Once resolved a person can still be infected again.Generally treatment options are limited. Injecting the lesion with cidofovir or applying imiquimod has been tried. It is sometimes necessary to cut them out. The vaccine used in sheep to prevent orf is live and has been known to cause disease in humans.The disease is endemic in livestock herds worldwide. A recent outbreak emerged in southwest Ethiopia between October 2019 and May 2020."

        "article": "Chickenpox or chicken pox also known as varicella is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) a member of the herpesvirus family. The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small itchy blisters which eventually scab over. It usually starts on the chest back and face. It then spreads to the rest of the body. The rash and other symptoms such as fever tiredness and headaches usually last five to seven days. Complications may occasionally include pneumonia inflammation of the brain and bacterial skin infections. The disease is usually more severe in adults than in children.Chickenpox is an airborne disease which easily spreads via human-to-human transmission typically through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. The incubation period is 10\u201321 days after which the characteristic rash appears. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is immune. People usually only get chickenpox once. Although reinfections by the virus occur these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms.Since its introduction in 1995 in the United States the varicella vaccine has resulted in a decrease in the number of cases and complications from the disease. It protects about 70\u201390 percent of people from disease with a greater benefit for severe disease. Routine immunization of children is recommended in many countries. Immunization within three days of exposure may improve outcomes in children. Treatment of those infected may include calamine lotion to help with itching keeping the fingernails short to decrease injury from scratching and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to help with fevers. For those at increased risk of complications antiviral medication such as aciclovir is recommended.Chickenpox occurs in all parts of the world. In 2013 there were 140 million cases of chickenpox and shingles worldwide. Before routine immunization the number of cases occurring each year was similar to the number of people born. Since immunization the number of infections in the United States has decreased nearly 90%. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6400 deaths globally \u2013 down from 8900 in 1990. Death occurs in about 1 per 60000 cases. Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century. In 1888 its connection to shingles was determined. The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658. Various explanations have been suggested for the use of \"chicken\" in the name one being the relative mildness of the disease."

For this reason the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception (probably several months before) as well as throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child up to and including the risk for cancer cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes throughout life.An inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished. An estimated 24% of babies worldwide are born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition. Personal habits such as consumption of alcohol or large amounts of caffeine can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby which happens in the early stages of pregnancy.Caffeine consumption during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss. The available research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however the type of fish is important.

        "article": "Eosinophilia is a condition in which the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood exceeds 5\u00d7108/L (500/\u03bcL). Hypereosinophilia is an elevation in an individual's circulating blood eosinophil count above 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L  (i.e. 1500/\u03bcL). The hypereosinophilic syndrome is a sustained elevation in this count above 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L (i.e. 1500/\u03bcL) that is also associated with evidence of eosinophil-based tissue injury.Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes. A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia. Several causes are known with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitic infection. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC) but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic in which the factor lies outside the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia which denotes etiologies within the eosinophil cell line.  Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition though in idiopathic eosinophilia the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids. Eosinophilia is not a disorder (rather only a sign) unless it is idiopathic.Informally blood eosinophil levels are often regarded as mildly elevated at counts of 500\u20131500/\u03bcL moderately elevated between 1500 and 5000/\u03bcL and severely elevated when greater than 5000/\u03bcL. Elevations in blood eosinophil counts can be transient sustained recurrent or cyclical.Eosinophil counts in human blood normally range between 100 and 500 per/\u03bcL. Maintenance of these levels results from a balance between production of eosinophils by bone marrow eosinophil precursor cells termed CFU-Eos and the emigration of circulating eosinophils out of the blood through post-capillary venules into tissues. Eosinophils represent a small percentage of peripheral blood leucocytes (usually less than 8%) have a half-life in the circulation of only 8\u201318 hours but persist in tissues for at least several weeks.Eosinophils are one form of terminally differentiated granulocytes; they function to neutralize invading microbes primarily parasites and helminthes but also certain types of fungi and viruses. They also participate in transplant rejection Graft-versus-host disease and the killing of tumor cells. In conducting these functions eosinophils produce and release on demand a range of toxic reactive oxygen species (e.g. hypobromite hypobromous acid superoxide and peroxide) and they also release on demand a preformed armamentarium of cytokines chemokines growth factors lipid mediators (e.g. leukotrienes prostaglandins platelet activating factor) and toxic proteins (e.g. metalloproteinases major basic protein eosinophil cationic protein eosinophil peroxidase and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin). These agents serve to orchestrate robust immune and inflammatory responses that destroy invading microbes foreign tissue and malignant cells. When overproduced and over-activated which occurs in certain cases of hypereosinophilia and to a lesser extent eosinophilia eosinophils may misdirect their reactive oxygen species and armamentarium of preformed molecules toward normal tissues. This can result in serious damage to such organs as the lung heart kidneys and brain."

It is suspected to be an autoimmune disorder. It may be triggered by bites from insects and arachnids such as spiders fleas or ticks or from medications or surgery. Diagnosis is made after other potential cases are ruled out. Skin biopsy of the affected areas may show an increased number of eosinophils. Other conditions that may appear similar include cellulitis contact dermatitis and severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.Treatment is often with a corticosteroids. Steroids applied as a cream is generally recommended over the use of steroids by mouth. Antihistamines may be used to help with itchiness. Many times the condition goes away after a few weeks without treatment. The condition is uncommon. It affects both sexes with the same frequency.

They are allergic hypersensitivity reactions caused by the non-toxic allergenic proteins contained in the saliva injected by a female mosquito (male mosquitos do not take blood-meals) at the time it takes its blood meal and are not caused by any toxin or pathogen.  By general agreement mosquito bite allergies do not include the ordinary wheal and flare responses to these bites although these reactions are also allergic in nature. Ordinary mosquito bite allergies are nonetheless detailed here because they are the best understood reactions to mosquito bites and provide a basis for describing what is understood about them.Mosquito bite allergies are informally classified as 1) the skeeter syndrome i.e. severe local skin reactions sometimes associated with low-grade fever; 2) systemic reactions that range from high-grade fever lymphadenopathy abdominal pain and/or diarrhea to very rarely life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis; and 3) severe and often systemic reactions occurring in individuals that have an Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease Epstein-Barr virus-negative lymphoid malignancy or another predisposing condition such as eosinophilic cellulitis or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The term papular urticaria is commonly used for a reaction to mosquito bites that is dominated by widely spread hives. Here papular urticaria is regarded as a symptom of mosquito bite allergy manifested in individuals with one of the other mosquito bite allergies but particularly in those associated with eosinophilic cellulitis.Mosquitos belong to the biological order of Diptera (which includes all two-winged insects) suborder Nematocera family Culicidea. There are &gt;3500 different mosquito species with the Aedes and Culex genera being common in North America. It is assumed that any species of mosquito that causes an ordinary mosquito bite reaction in humans is capable of causing mosquito bite allergies.  In addition to mosquitoes the Diptera order includes numerous other types of biting insects such as midges (e.g. sand flies) and gnats. Bites by the latter insects or possibly some other insects may cause reactions that are mechanistically and clinically similar to those seen with mosquito bites.Mosquito bite allergies occur more often where insect bites are frequent. Consequently cases (as well as various other allergic disorders) are more prevalent in tropical climates underdeveloped areas areas dominated by poverty poor hygiene and/or unawareness of these diseases and urban areas plagued by social inequality juvenile delinquency and violence. That is not only climate but also cultural and socioeconomic conditions play critical roles in facilitating the development and prevalence of diverse allergic disease including mosquito bite allergies."

Most cases are caused by a viral infection. Recurrent episodes are more likely in persons with asthma cystic fibrosis and poor immune function. In early stages an ENT doctor confirms sinusitis using nasal endoscopy. Diagnostic imaging is not usually needed in acute stage unless complications are suspected. In chronic cases confirmatory testing is recommended by either direct visualization or computed tomography.Some cases may be prevented by hand washing immunization and avoiding smoking. Pain killers such as naproxen nasal steroids and nasal irrigation may be used to help with symptoms. Recommended initial treatment for acute sinusitis is watchful waiting. If symptoms do not improve in 7\u201310 days or get worse then an antibiotic may be used or changed. In those in whom antibiotics are used either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line with amoxicillin/clavulanate being superior to amoxicillin alone but with more side effects. Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease or in someone who is not responding to medicines as per doctor's expectation.Sinusitis is a common condition. It affects between about 10 and 30 percent of people each year in the United States and Europe. Chronic sinusitis affects about 12.5% of people. Treatment of sinusitis in the United States results in more than US$11 billion in costs. The unnecessary and ineffective treatment of viral sinusitis with antibiotics is common."

It presents with large blisters in the skin a fever and swollen glands historically typically following contact with an infected cow though in the last several decades more often (though overall rarely) from infected cats. The hands and face are most frequently affected and the spots are generally very painful.The virus part of the genus Orthopoxvirus is closely related to the vaccinia virus. The virus is zoonotic meaning that it is transferable between species such as from cat to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairy workers who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands. Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to but much milder than the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairy farmers were immune to smallpox inspired the modern smallpox vaccine created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.The first description of cowpox was given by Jenner in 1798. \"Vaccination\" is derived from the Latin adjective vaccinus meaning \"of or from the cow\".  Once vaccinated a patient develops antibodies that make them immune to cowpox but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus or Variola virus. The cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in 1980 the World Health Organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide. Other orthopox viruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans such as the cowpox virus in Europe and monkeypox virus in Central and West Africa."

        "article": "Genital herpes is a herpes infection of the genitals caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Most people either have no or mild symptoms and thus do not know they are infected. When symptoms do occur they typically include small blisters that break open to form painful ulcers. Flu-like symptoms such as fever aching or swollen lymph nodes may also occur. Onset is typically around 4 days after exposure with symptoms lasting up to 4 weeks. Once infected further outbreaks may occur but are generally milder.The disease is typically spread by direct genital contact with the skin surface or secretions of someone who is infected. This may occur during sex including anal oral and manual sex. Sores are not required for transmission to occur. The risk of spread between a couple is about 7.5% over a year. HSV is classified into two types HSV-1 and HSV-2. While historically HSV-2 was more common genital HSV-1 has become more common in the developed world. Diagnosis may occur by testing lesions using either PCR or viral culture or blood tests for specific antibodies.Efforts to prevent infection include not having sex using condoms and only having sex with someone who is not infected. Once infected there is no cure. Antiviral medications may however prevent outbreaks or shorten outbreaks if they occur. The long-term use of antivirals may also decrease the risk of further spread.In 2015 about 846 million people (12% of the world population) had genital herpes. In the United States more than one in six people between the ages of 14 and 49 have the disease. Women are more commonly infected than men. Rates of disease caused by HSV-2 have decreased in the United States between 1990 and 2010. Complications may rarely include aseptic meningitis an increased risk of HIV/AIDS if exposed to HIV-positive individuals and spread to the baby during childbirth resulting in neonatal herpes."

Human parvovirus b19 is a below-species classification of Erythroparvovirus primate1. The name is derived from Latin parvum meaning small reflecting the fact that B19 ranks among the smallest DNA viruses. B19 virus is most known for causing disease in the pediatric population; however it can also affect adults. It is the classic cause of the childhood rash called fifth disease or erythema infectiosum or \"slapped cheek syndrome\". The name comes from it being the fifth in a list of historical classifications of common skin rash illnesses in children. The virus was discovered by chance in 1975 by Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart. The name B19 originated from the coding of a serum sample number 19 in panel B."

        "article": "A Bartholin's cyst occurs when a Bartholin's gland within the labia becomes blocked. Small cysts may result in minimal or no symptoms. Larger cysts may result in swelling on one side of the vaginal opening as well as pain during sex or walking. If the cyst becomes infected an abscess can occur which is typically red and very painful. If there are no symptoms no treatment is needed. Bartholin's cysts affect about 2% of women at some point in their life. They most commonly occur during childbearing years.When the cyst becomes uncomfortable or painful drainage is recommended. The preferred method is the insertion of a Word catheter for four weeks as recurrence following simple incision and drainage is common. A surgical procedure known as marsupialization may be used or if the problems persist the entire gland may be removed. Removal is sometimes recommended in those older than 40 to ensure cancer is not present. Antibiotics are not generally needed to treat a Bartholin's cyst.The cause of a Bartholin's cyst is unknown. An abscess results from a bacterial infection but it is not usually a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Rarely gonorrhea may be involved. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination. In women over the age of 40 a tissue biopsy is often recommended to rule out cancer.The cyst is named after Caspar Bartholin who accurately described the glands in 1677. The underlying mechanism of the cyst was determined in 1967 by the obstetrician Samuel Buford Word."

        "article": "A cyst is a closed sac having a distinct envelope and division compared with the nearby tissue. Hence it is a cluster of cells that have grouped together to form a sac (like the manner in which water molecules group together to form a bubble); however the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the \"shell\" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal (in both appearance and behaviour) when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. A cyst may contain air fluids or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess not a cyst. Once formed a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve it may need to be removed surgically but that would depend upon its type and location.Cancer-related cysts are formed as a defense mechanism for the body following the development of mutations that lead to an uncontrolled cellular division. Once that mutation has occurred the affected cells divide incessantly and become cancerous forming a tumor. The body encapsulates those cells to try to prevent them from continuing their division and contain the tumor which becomes known as a cyst. That said the cancerous cells still may mutate further and gain the ability to form their own blood vessels from which they receive nourishment before being contained. Once that happens the capsule becomes useless and the tumor may advance from benign to cancerous.Some cysts are neoplastic and thus are called cystic tumors. Many types of cysts are not neoplastic they are dysplastic or metaplastic. Pseudocysts are similar to cysts in that they have a sac filled with fluid but lack an epithelial lining."

It can appear anywhere from one day to one month after a tick bite.  This rash does not represent an allergic reaction to the bite but rather an actual skin infection of one of the Lyme bacteria species from the genus Borrelia. The rash's name comes from Neo-Latin for \"migrating redness.\""

It occurs on the lower abdomen and inner thighs and is due to the use of a Kanger a ceramic pot covered with wicker-work carried as a source of warmth during cold weather. One of the earliest records of the condition was made in 1881 by surgeons at the Kashmir Mission Hospital and its cause was recognized in the early 20th century by Arthur Neve.Despite current knowledge of the cause of this condition cases are still being reported.Other conditions associated with prolonged use of kangri in this fashion include erythema ab igne a reticulate hypermelanosis with erythema."

        "article": " A laptop computer or notebook computer also known as a laptop or notebook is a small portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems which were originally developed for desktop computers.Laptops can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation making them suitable for mobile use. Laptops are used in a variety of settings such as at work (especially on business trips) in education for playing games web browsing for personal multimedia and for general home computer use.The word laptop modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer) refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user's lap; while the word notebook refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with paper notebooks. As of 2024 in American English the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably; in other dialects of English one or the other may be preferred. The term notebook originally referred to a type of portable computer that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time but has since come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.Laptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit including a display screen (usually 11\u201317\u00a0in or 280\u2013430\u00a0mm in diagonal size) small speakers a keyboard and a pointing device (namely compact ones such as touchpads or pointing sticks). Most modern laptops include a built-in webcam and microphone and many also have touchscreens. Hardware specifications may vary significantly between different types models and price points.Design elements form factors and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include 2-in-1 laptops with keyboards that either be detached or pivoted out of view from the display (often marketed having a \"laptop mode\"); rugged laptops for use in construction or military applications; and low-production-cost laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organization which incorporate features like solar charging and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. Portable computers which later developed into modern laptops were originally considered to be a small niche market mostly for specialized field applications such as in the military for accountants or traveling sales representatives. As portable computers evolved into modern laptops they became widely used for a variety of purposes."

In rare cases such as Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.Albinism results from inheritance of recessive gene alleles and is known to affect all vertebrates including humans. It is due to absence or defect of tyrosinase a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Unlike humans other animals have multiple pigments and for these albinism is considered to be a hereditary condition characterised by the absence of melanin in particular in the eyes skin hair scales feathers or cuticle. While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an albino an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as leucistic or albinoid.

While agents such as certain medications radiographic contrast pesticides infection with parasites and HIV have been implicated in the occurrence of this disease the cause of this skin disease remains unknown.EDP initially presents as grey or blue-brown circumferential or irregularly shaped macules or patches that appear. While the lesions of EDP are generally non-elevated they may initially have a slight raised red margin as they first begin to appear. These lesions usually arise in a symmetric distribution and involve the trunk but also commonly spread to the face and extremities. EDP does not usually have symptoms beside the macules and patches of discolored skin; however some itching in these areas may occur.Because EDP is an uncommon disease of the skin it is important to consider other skin diseases that may resemble erythema dyschromicum perstans such as infectious diseases (i.e. leprosy or pinta) reaction to drugs post inflammatory hyperpigmentation or lichen planus pigmentosus.There is no cure for EDP.

Which period is shorter depends on the disease. A person may carry a disease such as Streptococcus in the throat without exhibiting any symptoms. Depending on the disease the person may or may not be contagious during the incubation period.During latency an infection is subclinical. With respect to viral infections in incubation the virus is replicating. This is in contrast to viral latency a form of dormancy in which the virus does not replicate. An example of latency is  HIV infection. HIV may at first have no symptoms and show no signs of AIDS despite HIV replicating in the lymphatic system and rapidly accumulating a large viral load.

Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and does not need to be confirmed with blood tests (PCR or antigen). Low numbers of white blood cells may also be present.Treatment includes sufficient fluids and medications to treat the fever. Nearly all people are infected at some point in time.

The radiation types of greatest concern are thermal radiation radio frequency energy ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation.The most common type of radiation burn is a sunburn caused by UV radiation. High exposure to X-rays during diagnostic medical imaging or radiotherapy can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with cells within the body\u2014damaging them\u2014the body responds to this damage typically resulting in erythema\u2014that is redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often discussed in the same context as radiation-induced cancer due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage DNA occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. Cavity magnetrons can be improperly used to create surface and internal burning. Depending on the photon energy gamma radiation can cause deep gamma burns with 60Co internal burns common. Beta burns tend to be shallow as beta particles are not able to penetrate deeply into a body; these burns can be similar to sunburn. Alpha particles can cause internal alpha burns if inhaled with external damage (if any) being limited to minor erythema.Radiation burns can also occur with high power radio transmitters at any frequency where the body absorbs radio frequency energy and converts it to heat. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) considers 50 watts to be the lowest power above which radio stations must evaluate emission safety. Frequencies considered especially dangerous occur where the human body can become resonant at 35\u00a0MHz 70\u00a0MHz 80-100\u00a0MHz 400\u00a0MHz and 1\u00a0GHz.

The disease usually begins in the lungs skin or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes liver heart and brain though any organ can be affected. The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved. Often no or only mild symptoms are seen. When it affects the lungs wheezing coughing shortness of breath or chest pain may occur. Some may have L\u00f6fgren syndrome with fever large lymph nodes arthritis and a rash known as erythema nodosum.The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk. Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level or elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the blood. The diagnosis should be made only after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.Sarcoidosis may resolve without any treatment within a few years. However some people may have long-term or severe disease. Some symptoms may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. In cases where the condition causes significant health problems steroids such as prednisone are indicated. Medications such as methotrexate chloroquine or azathioprine may occasionally be used in an effort to decrease the side effects of steroids. The risk of death is  1\u20137%. The chance of the disease returning in someone who has had it previously is less than 5%.In 2015 pulmonary sarcoidosis and interstitial lung disease affected 1.9 million people globally and they resulted in 122000 deaths. It is most common in Scandinavians but occurs in all parts of the world. In the United States risk is greater among black  people as opposed to white people. It usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50. It occurs more often in women than men.

        "article": "A blacklight also called a UV-A light Wood's lamp or ultraviolet light  is a lamp that emits long-wave (UV-A) ultraviolet light and very little visible light.  One type of lamp has a violet filter material either on the bulb or in a separate glass filter in the lamp housing which blocks most visible light and allows through UV so the lamp has a dim violet glow when operating.  Blacklight lamps which have this filter have a lighting industry designation that includes the letters \"BLB\".  This stands for \"blacklight blue\".   A second type of lamp produces ultraviolet but does not have the filter material so it produces more visible light and has a blue color when operating.  These tubes are made for use in \"bug zapper\" insect traps and are identified by the industry designation \"BL\". This stands for \"blacklight\".Blacklight sources may be specially designed fluorescent lamps mercury-vapor lamps light-emitting diodes (LEDs) lasers or incandescent lamps.  In medicine forensics and some other scientific fields such a light source is referred to as a Wood's lamp named after Robert Williams Wood who invented the original Wood's glass UV filters.Although many other types of lamp emit ultraviolet light with visible light black lights are essential when UV-A light without visible light is needed particularly in observing fluorescence the colored glow that many substances emit when exposed to UV.  Black lights are employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine the detection of substances tagged with fluorescent dyes rock-hunting scorpion-hunting the detection of counterfeit money the curing of plastic resins attracting insects and the detection of refrigerant leaks affecting refrigerators and air conditioning systems. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in tanning beds."

        "article": "Erythrasma is a superficial skin infection that causes brown scaly skin patches. It is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum bacteria a normal part of skin flora (the microorganisms that are normally present on the skin).There are two types of erythrasma: generalized and interdigital. Interdigital is the most common bacterial infection of the feet and normally does not show any symptoms. Not only is this an aesthetically unappealing condition but there is evidence to support that disciform erythrasma can be an early sign of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The generalized erythrasma is most commonly seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus where the lesions go beyond the areas of the body where skin is rubbing together. It is prevalent among diabetics and the obese and in warm climates; it is worsened by wearing occlusive clothing.The presence of erythrasma is approximately 4% and is more likely to be found in the subtropical and tropical areas compared to the rest of the world. It is found more commonly in African Americans due to the darker skin and  even though both sexes are affected it is usually found more frequently in males for the thigh and leg regions. A great contributor to this infection is a weakened immune system which comes with aging therefore the elderly are more susceptible to this disease than the young; this does not mean the young cannot be affected. The epidemiology background of erythrasma remains partially unsolved."

These areas are more susceptible to irritation and subsequent infection due to factors that promote skin breakdown such as moisture friction and exposure to bodily secretions and excreta such as sweat urine or feces. Areas of the body which are more likely to be affected by intertrigo include the inframammary fold intergluteal cleft armpits and spaces between the fingers or toes. Skin affected by intertrigo is more prone to infection than intact skin.The term \"intertrigo\" commonly refers to a secondary infection with bacteria (such as Corynebacterium minutissimum) fungi (such as Candida albicans) or viruses. A frequent manifestation is candidal intertrigo.Intertrigo occurs more often in warm and humid conditions. Generally intertrigo is more common in people with a weakened immune system including children the elderly and immunocompromised people. The condition is also more common in people who experience urinary incontinence and decreased ability to move."

This can occur in various locations such as coronary blood vessels peripheral arteries and veins. The narrowed arteries would block the blood supply to different organs and tissues. In severe conditions it may develop into more critical health problems like myocardial infarction stroke or heart failure which are some of the major reasons of death.There are many causes contributing to blood vessel disorder including high blood cholesterol and calcium levels blood clot formation and inflammation of arteries. It is found that age sedentary lifestyle diets rich in lipids smoking diabetes and family history of cardiovascular diseases are common risk factors. A mild degree of blood vessel disorder may be asymptomatic. Blood tests on cholesterol and calcium level can be performed to monitor the risk of having the disorder. Additionally techniques such as angiography and ultrasound imaging are useful tools for diagnosis. It can be treated by both medication or surgery depending on the type of blood vessel disorder."

In a limb with a normal circulation the toes and sole of the foot stay pink even when the limb is raised by 90 degrees. In an ischaemic leg elevation to 15 degrees or 30 degrees for 30 to 60 seconds may cause pallor. (This part of the test checks for elevation pallor.)  A vascular angle of less than 20 degrees indicates severe ischaemia.From a sitting position in normal circulation the foot will quickly return to a pink colour. Where there is peripheral artery disease the leg will revert to the pink colour more slowly than normal and also pass through the normal pinkness to a red-range colouring (rubor - redness) often known as sunset foot. This is due to the dilatation of the arterioles in an attempt to rid the metabolic waste that has built up in a reactive hyperaemia. Finally the foot will return to its normal colour.

There is severe burning pain (in the small fiber sensory nerves) and skin redness. The attacks are periodic and are commonly triggered by heat pressure mild activity exertion insomnia or stress. Erythromelalgia may occur either as a primary or secondary disorder (i.e. a disorder in and of itself or a symptom of another condition). Secondary erythromelalgia can result from small fiber peripheral neuropathy of any cause polycythemia vera essential thrombocythemia hypercholesterolemia mushroom or mercury poisoning and some autoimmune disorders. Primary erythromelalgia is caused by mutation of the voltage-gated sodium channel \u03b1-subunit gene SCN9A.In 2004 erythromelalgia became the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain when its link to the SCN9A gene was initially published in the Journal of Medical Genetics. Later that year in an article in The Journal of Neuroscience Cummins et al. demonstrated using voltage clamp recordings that these mutations enhanced the function of NaV1.7 sodium channels which are preferentially expressed within peripheral neurons.  One year later in an article in Brain Dib-Hajj et al. demonstrated that NaV1.7 mutants channels from families with inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) make dorsal root ganglion (DRG peripheral and sensory) neurons hyper excitable thereby demonstrating the mechanistic link between these mutations and pain thereby firmly establishing NaV1.7 gain-of-function mutations as the molecular basis for IEM. Conversely in December 2006 a University of Cambridge team reported an SCN9A mutation that resulted in a complete lack of pain sensation in a Pakistani street performer and some of his family members. He felt no pain walked on hot coals and stabbed himself to entertain crowds.  By 2013 nearly a dozen gain-of-function mutations of NaV1.7 had been linked to IEM.  The multi-decades search which identified gene SCN9A as the cause of inherited erythomelalgia is documented in a book by Stephen Waxman Chasing Men on Fire: The Story of the Search for a Pain Gene."

It is passed on from child to child. It is uncommon for adults to contract this disease as most people have had it by kindergarten and once contracted immunity arises and prevents future reinfection. Additionally HHV-6B reactivation is common in transplant recipients which can cause several clinical manifestations such as encephalitis bone marrow suppression and pneumonitis.A variety of tests are used in the detection of HHV-6 some of which do not differentiate the two species.Both viruses can cause transplacental infection and be passed on to a newborn."

This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever sore throat and fatigue may also occur. Joint pain is common in adults. Complications may include bleeding problems testicular swelling encephalitis and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a miscarriage or a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Symptoms of CRS manifest as problems with the eyes such as cataracts deafness as well as affecting the heart and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.Rubella is usually spread from one person to the next through the air via coughs of people who are infected. People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash. Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year. Only humans are infected. Insects do not spread the disease. Once recovered people are immune to future infections. Testing is available that can verify immunity. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding the virus in the blood throat or urine. Testing the blood for antibodies may also be useful.Rubella is preventable with the rubella vaccine with a single dose being more than 95% effective. Often it is given in combination with the measles vaccine and mumps vaccine known as the MMR vaccine. When some but less than 80% of a population is vaccinated more women may reach childbearing age without developing immunity by infection or vaccination thus possibly raising CRS rates. Once infected there is no specific treatment.Rubella is a common infection in many areas of the world. Each year about 100000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome occur. Rates of disease have decreased in many areas as a result of vaccination. There are ongoing efforts to eliminate the disease globally. In April 2015 the World Health Organization declared the Americas free of rubella transmission. The name \"rubella\" is from Latin and means little red. It was first described as a separate disease by German physicians in 1814 resulting in the name \"German measles\"."

The dimensions of the virion are roughly 360 \u00d7 270 \u00d7 250\u00a0nm with a mass of approximately 5\u201310 fg. The vaccinia virus is the source of the modern smallpox vaccine which the World Health Organization (WHO) used to eradicate smallpox in a global vaccination campaign in 1958\u20131977. Although smallpox no longer exists in the wild vaccinia virus is still studied widely by scientists as a tool for gene therapy and genetic engineering.Smallpox had been an endemic human disease that had a 30% fatality rate. In 1796 the British doctor Edward Jenner proved that an infection with the relatively mild cowpox virus would also confer immunity to the deadly smallpox. Jenner referred to cowpox as variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow). However the origins of the smallpox vaccine became murky over time especially after Louis Pasteur developed laboratory techniques for creating vaccines in the 19th century. Allan Watt Downie demonstrated in 1939 that the modern smallpox vaccine was serologically distinct from cowpox and vaccinia was subsequently recognized as a separate viral species. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed that vaccinia is most closely related to horsepox and the cowpox strains found in Great Britain are the least closely related to vaccinia."

        "article": "Body hair or androgenic hair is terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. It is different from head hair and also from less visible vellus hair which is much finer and lighter in color. Growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens (male hormones) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.From childhood onward regardless of sex vellus hair covers almost the entire area of the human body. Exceptions include the lips the backs of the ears palms of hands soles of the feet certain external genital areas the navel and scar tissue. Density of hair \u2013 i.e. the number of hair follicles per unit area of skin \u2013 varies from person to person. In many cases areas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker and thicker body hair during puberty such as the first growth of beard hair on a male and female adolescent's previously smooth chin; although it may appear thinner on the female.Androgenic hair follows the same growth pattern as the hair that grows on the scalp but with a shorter anagen phase and longer telogen phase. While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years the androgenic hair growth phase for body hair lasts a few months. The telogen phase for hair lasts for varying lengths of time depending on where the hair is from a few weeks up to nearly a year. This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body. Differences in length seen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair for example can be explained by varied growth cycles in those regions. The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people especially when comparing men and women."

        "article": "Hirsutism is excessive body hair on parts of the body where hair is normally absent or minimal. The word is from early 17th century: from Latin hirsutus meaning \"hairy\". It usually refers to a male pattern of hair growth in a female that may be a sign of a more serious medical condition especially if it develops well after puberty. Cultural stigma against hirsutism can cause much psychological distress and social difficulty. Discrimination based on facial hirsutism often leads to the avoidance of social situations and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.Hirsutism is usually the result of an underlying endocrine imbalance which may be adrenal ovarian or central. It can be caused by increased levels of androgen hormones. The amount and location of the hair is measured by a Ferriman-Gallwey score. It is different from hypertrichosis which is excessive hair growth anywhere on the body.Treatments may include certain birth control pills antiandrogens or insulin sensitizers.Hirsutism affects between 5 and 15% of women across all ethnic backgrounds. Depending on the definition and the underlying data approximately 40% of women have some degree of facial hair. About 10 to 15% of cases of hirsutism are idiopathic with no known cause."

Hypertrichosis can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life.  The excess growth of hair occurs in areas of the skin with the exception of androgen-dependent hair of the pubic area face and axillary regions.Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries such as Julia Pastrana had hypertrichosis.

The clinical presentation of this disease is similar to the characteristics of mammary Paget's disease (MPD). However unlike MPD which occurs in large lactiferous ducts and then extends into the epidermis EMPD originates in glandular regions rich in apocrine secretions outside the mammary glands. EMPD incidence is increasing by 3.2% every year affecting hormonally-targeted tissues such as the vulva and scrotum. In women 81.3% of EMPD cases are related to the vulva while for men 43.2% of the manifestations present at the scrotum.The disease can be classified as being either primary or secondary depending on the presence or absence of associated malignancies. EMPD presents with typical symptoms such as scaly erythematous eczematous lesions accompanied by itchiness. In addition to this 10% of patients are often asymptomatic. As a consequence EMPD has high rates of misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses. There are a variety of treatment options available but most are unsuccessful. If caught early and treated prognosis is generally good."

        "article": "Neutron capture therapy (NCT) is a type of radiotherapy for treating locally invasive malignant tumors such as primary brain tumors recurrent cancers of the head and neck region and cutaneous and extracutaneous melanomas. It is a two-step process: first the patient is injected with a tumor-localizing drug containing the stable isotope boron-10 (10B) which has a high propensity to capture low energy \"thermal\" neutrons. The neutron cross section of 10B (3837 barns) is 1000 times more than that of other elements such as nitrogen hydrogen or oxygen that occur in tissue. In the second step the patient is radiated with epithermal neutrons the sources of which in the past have been nuclear reactors and now are accelerators that produce higher energy epithermal neutrons. After losing energy as they penetrate tissue the resultant low energy \"thermal\" neutrons are captured by the 10B atoms. The resulting decay reaction yields high-energy alpha particles that kill the cancer cells that have taken up enough 10B.All clinical experience with NCT to date is with boron-10; hence this method is known as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Use of another non-radioactive isotope such as gadolinium has been limited to experimental animal studies and has not been done clinically. BNCT has been evaluated as an alternative to conventional radiation therapy for malignant brain tumors such as glioblastomas which presently are incurable and more recently locally advanced recurrent cancers of the head and neck region and much less often superficial melanomas mainly involving the skin and genital region."

These hidradenomas are sharply circumscribed nodular tumors that usually develop in women's anogenital area (particularly the vulva) but uncommonly occur in other sites in women and men. Papillary hidradenomas that develop outside of the anogenital region are termed ecctopic papillary hidradenomas or ectopic hidradenoma papilliferums.Anogenital papillary hidradenomas are regarded as tumors that form in anogenital mammary\u2013like glands (MLAGs); MLAGs are a type of apocrine gland. MLAGs were once classified as abnormally located breast tissue glands (see accessory breast tissue@ https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-11125) but are now considered to be normal components of the anogenital region. Microscopically papillary hidradenomas often resemble certain types of breast tumors. Ectopic papillary hidradenomas are thought to be tumors of apocrine glands which have an as yet unclear relationship to MLAGs.Typically papillary hidradenomas are solitary slow-growing small tumors that may have been present for months to many years before the time of diagnosis. The tumors are usually symptomless but may be intermittently or constantly painful become ulcerated and exhibit minor levels of bleeding. The pain resulting from these tumors may be simple tenderness more or less constant usually mild pain or in females dyspareunia i.e. pain during and just after sexual intercourse.Rarely papillary hidradenomas have progressed to what appear to be 1) in situ malignancies (i.e. malignancies that have neither metastasized nor invaded beyond the layer of tissue where they arose); 2) locally invasive malignancies; or 3) complex tumors intermixed with other malignancies such as extramammary Paget disease melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore benign papillary hidradenoma tumors may be confused clinically with cancerous tumors and recent studies have indicated that other types of tumors have often been mistakenly diagnosed as papillary hidradenomas. Papillary hidradenomas particularly ectopic papillary hidradenomas require further study to better define the criteria for their diagnosis."

The disorder is characterized by bruising fatigue anemia low blood platelet count and enlargement of the liver and spleen and is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase) which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective glucocerebroside accumulates particularly in white blood cells and especially in macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes which is often a target for intracellular parasites). Glucocerebroside can collect in the spleen liver kidneys lungs brain and bone marrow.Manifestations may include enlarged spleen and liver liver malfunction skeletal disorders or bone lesions that may be painful severe neurological complications swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints distended abdomen a brownish tint to the skin anemia low blood platelet count and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye (sclera). Persons seriously affected may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.The disease is caused by a recessive mutation in the GBA gene located on chromosome 1 and affects both males and females. About one in 100 people in the United States are carriers of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among Ashkenazi Jews is 8.9% while the birth incidence is 1 in 450.Gaucher's  disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage diseases.

        "article": "Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a female the testicles in a male. In response to the signals the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth function and transformation of the brain bones muscle blood skin hair breasts and sex organs. Physical growth\u2014height and weight\u2014accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Before puberty the external sex organs known as primary sexual characteristics are sex characteristics that distinguish males and females. Puberty leads to sexual dimorphism through the development of the secondary sex characteristics which further distinguish the sexes.On average females begin puberty at ages 10\u201311 and complete puberty at ages 15\u201317; males generally begin puberty at ages 11\u201312 and complete puberty at ages 16\u201317. The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche the onset of menstruation which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13. For males first ejaculation spermarche occurs on average at age 13. In the 21st century the average age at which children especially females reach specific markers of puberty is lower compared to the 19th century when it was 15 for females and 17 for males (with age at first periods for females and voice-breaks for males being used as examples). This can be due to any number of factors including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth increased weight and fat deposition or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors. However more modern archeological research suggests that the rate of puberty as it occurs now is the intended way. Growth spurts began at around 10\u201312 but markers of later stages of puberty such as menarche had delays that correlated with severe environmental conditions such as poverty poor nutrition air and pollution. Puberty that starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty.Notable among the morphologic changes in size shape composition and functioning of the pubertal body is the development of secondary sex characteristics the \"filling in\" of the child's body; from girl to woman from boy to man. Derived from the Latin puberatum (age of maturity) the word puberty describes the physical changes to sexual maturation not the psychosocial and cultural maturation denoted by the term adolescent development in Western culture wherein adolescence is the period of mental transition from childhood to adulthood which overlaps much of the body's period of puberty."

The underlying mechanism remains unknown but research suggests that extracellular vesicles might be involved."

        "article": "Parvoviruses are a family of animal viruses that constitute the family Parvoviridae. They have linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes that typically contain two genes encoding for a replication initiator protein called NS1 and the protein the viral capsid is made of. The coding portion of the genome is flanked by telomeres at each end that form into hairpin loops that are important during replication. Parvovirus virions are small compared to most viruses at 23\u201328 nanometers in diameter and contain the genome enclosed in an icosahedral capsid that has a rugged surface.Parvoviruses enter a host cell by endocytosis travelling to the nucleus where they wait until the cell enters its replication stage. At that point the genome is uncoated and the coding portion is replicated. Viral messenger RNA (mRNA) is then transcribed and translated resulting in NS1 initiating replication. During replication the hairpins repeatedly unfold are replicated and refold to change the direction of replication to progress back and forth along the genome in a process called rolling hairpin replication that produces a molecule containing numerous copies of the genome. Progeny ssDNA genomes are excised from this concatemer and packaged into capsids. Mature virions leave the cell by exocytosis or lysis.Parvoviruses are believed to be descended from ssDNA viruses that have circular genomes that form a loop because these viruses encode a replication initiator protein that is related to NS1 and have a similar replication mechanism. Another group of viruses called bidnaviruses appear to be descended from parvoviruses. Within the family three subfamilies 26 genera and 126 species are recognized. Parvoviridae is the sole family in the order Piccovirales which is the sole order in the class Quintoviricetes. This class is assigned to the phylum Cossaviricota which also includes papillomaviruses polyomaviruses and bidnaviruses.A variety of diseases in animals are caused by parvoviruses. Notably the canine parvovirus and feline parvovirus cause severe disease in dogs and cats respectively. In pigs the porcine parvovirus is a major cause of infertility. Human parvoviruses are less severe the two most notable being parvovirus B19 which causes a variety of illnesses including fifth disease in children and human bocavirus 1 which is a common cause of acute respiratory tract illness especially in young children. In medicine recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have become an important vector for delivering genes to the cell nucleus during gene therapy.Animal parvoviruses were first discovered in the 1960s including minute virus of mice which is frequently used to study parvovirus replication. Many AAVs were also discovered during this time period and research on them over time has revealed their benefit as a form of medicine. The first pathogenic human parvovirus to be discovered was parvovirus B19 in 1974 which became associated with various diseases throughout the 1980s. Parvoviruses were first classified as the genus Parvovirus in 1971 but were elevated to family status in 1975. They take their name from the Latin word parvum meaning 'small' or 'tiny' referring to the small size of the virus's virions."

In some parts of the world the term orphan disease describes a rare disease whose rarity results in little or no funding or research for treatments without financial incentives from governments or other agencies. Orphan drugs are medications targeting orphan diseases.Most rare diseases are genetic in origin and thus are present throughout the person's entire life even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life and about 30% of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthdays. With only four diagnosed patients in 27 years ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency is considered the 2nd rarest known genetic disease being beaten only by Fields Condition affecting two known individuals Catherine and Kirstie Fields.No single number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare.

However it has also been associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer in those who do drink.The reaction is also termed \"Asian flush\" due to its frequent occurrence in East Asians with approximately 30 to 50% of Chinese Japanese and Koreans showing characteristic physiological responses to drinking alcohol that includes facial flushing nausea headaches and a fast heart rate. The condition may be also highly prevalent in some Southeast Asian and Inuit populations."

Flush toilets can be designed for sitting or squatting in the case of squat toilets. Most modern sewage treatment systems are also designed to process specially designed toilet paper. The opposite of a flush toilet is a dry toilet which uses no water for flushing.Flush toilets are a type of plumbing fixture and usually incorporate an S- U- J- or P-shaped bend called a trap that causes water to collect in the toilet bowl to hold the waste and act as a seal against noxious sewer gases. Most flush toilets are connected to a sewerage system that conveys wastewater to a sewage treatment plant; alternatively a septic tank or composting system may be used.Associated devices are urinals which primarily dispose of urine and bidets which use water to cleanse the anus perineum and genitals after using the toilet."

Downtown Flushing is a major commercial and retail area and the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue at its core is the third-busiest in New York City behind Times Square and Herald Square.Flushing was established as a settlement of New Netherland on October 10 1645 on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek. It was named Vlissingen after the Dutch city of Vlissingen. The English took control of New Amsterdam in 1664 and when Queens County was established in 1683 the \"Town of Flushing\" was one of the original five towns of Queens. In 1898 Flushing was consolidated into the City of New York. Development came in the early 20th century with the construction of bridges and public transportation.  An immigrant population composed mostly of Chinese and Koreans settled in Flushing in the late 20th century.Flushing contains numerous residential subsections and its diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there. Flushing is served by several stations on the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch as well as the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line (7 and &lt;7&gt;\u200b trains) which has its terminus at Main Street.Flushing is located in Queens Community District 7 and its ZIP Codes are 11354 11355 and 11358.

Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park is the fourth-largest public park in New York City with a total area of 897 acres (363\u00a0ha).Until the 19th century the site consisted of wetlands straddling the Flushing River which traverses the region from north to south. Starting in the first decade of the 20th century it was used as a dumping ground for ashes since at the time the land was so far away from the developed parts of New York City as to be considered almost worthless. New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses first conceived the idea of developing a large park in Flushing Meadow in the 1920s as part of a system of parks across eastern Queens. Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park was created as the site of the 1939 New York World's Fair and also hosted the 1964 New York World's Fair. Following the 1964 fair the park fell into disrepair although some improvements have taken place since the 1990s and 2000s.Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park retains much of the layout from the 1939 World's Fair. Its attractions include the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center the current venue for the US Open tennis tournament; Citi Field the home of the New York Mets baseball team; the New York Hall of Science; the Queens Museum; the Queens Theatre in the Park; the Queens Zoo; the Unisphere; and the New York State Pavilion. It formerly contained Shea Stadium demolished in 2009. The Flushing River continues to run through the park and two large lakes called Meadow and Willow Lakes take up much of the park's area south of the Long Island Expressway.Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park is owned and maintained by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation also known as NYC Parks. Private non-profit groups such as the Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park Conservancy and the Alliance for Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park provide additional funds services and support. The park is at the eastern edge of the area encompassed by Queens Community Board 4."

Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant autosomal recessive and X-linked disorders. M\u00fcllerian anomalies can be part of a multiple malformation syndrome.M\u00fcllerian anomalies occur as a congenital malformation of the M\u00fcllerian ducts during embryogenesis. The M\u00fcllerian ducts are also referred to as paramesonephric ducts referring to ducts next to (para) the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct during foetal development. Paramesonephric ducts are paired ducts derived from the embryo and for females develop into the uterus uterine tubes cervix and upper two-thirds of the vagina. Embryogenesis of the M\u00fcllerian ducts play important roles in ensuring normal development of the female reproductive tract. However when defects in each of the three phases of embryogenesis occur it results in specific structural malformations which are distinguished according to anatomy into seven classes based on the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) classification system. Class I and II anomalies result from underdevelopment of the two separate primitive uterine vaginal and cervical pockets due to an arrest of stage one of organogenesis resulting in underdevelopment of both left and right primitive uterus (class I) or underdevelopment of one of the primitive uterus (class II). Class III and IV anomalies result from failure of midline fusion of the two separate primitive pockets due to an arrest of stage two of organogenesis. Class V and VI anomalies result from failure of degeneration of the midline due to an arrest at stage three of organogenesis. Class VII anomalies are malformations caused by Diethylstilbestrol (DES)."

It originally was a disease of only losing eyelashes but it currently is the loss of both eyelashes and eyebrows. Eyebrows and eyelashes are both important in the prevention of bacteria and other foreign objects from entering the eye. A majority of patients with madarosis have leprosy and it was reported that 76% of patients with varying types of leprosy had madarosis."

An associated itch may or may not be present. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a type of irritant folliculitis in the beard area.Mechanical factors that typically trigger irritant folliculitis include hair removal by razor waxing electrolysis and by plucking. Repeated rubbing of skin such as friction on the inner thighs may result in the irritation. Sunlight and prolonged pressure such as sitting on one's bottom for long periods of time may also trigger irritant folliculitis. Irritant folliculitis may occur following the use of some medications or contact with irritant chemicals such as cutting fluids and coal tar. Tight hair styles may cause irritant folliculitis on the scalp. Other factors that increase chances of skin friction and moisture include obesity. Diagnosis is generally by history and visualisation of the rash. The condition is not due to infection and swabs of the spots are typically negative. It may appear similar to acne and other types of infectious folliculitis.Treatment considers removing the triggering factor particularly to stop shaving. Prolonged use of the antibiotic doxycycline may be an option. If shaving is necessary the condition may be prevented by avoiding soap and applying a generous amount of shaving gel. Rubbing may be reduced by using powders.Any age may be affected. It is common on the lower legs of women who shave there."

This yeast is lipophilic requiring fatty acids that are present in oily skin to proliferate. It has been shown that Malassezia yeast grows by consuming fatty acids with carbon chain lengths C11 to C24.Malassezia is part of the normal skin flora but overgrows in certain conditions. Overgrowth is associated with oily skin humidity or other pre-existing dermatologic conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis and severe dandruff."

Symptoms may include large bruises fever weakness shortness of breath confusion and headache. Repeated episodes may occur.In about half of cases a trigger is identified while in the remainder the cause remains unknown. Known triggers include bacterial infections certain medications autoimmune diseases such as lupus and pregnancy. The underlying mechanism typically involves antibodies inhibiting the enzyme ADAMTS13. This results in decreased break down of large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) into smaller units. Less commonly TTP is inherited known as Upshaw\u2013Schulman syndrome such that ADAMTS13 dysfunction is present from birth. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and blood tests. It may be supported by measuring activity of or antibodies against ADAMTS13.With plasma exchange the risk of death has decreased from more than 90% to less than 20%. Immunosuppressants such as glucocorticoids and rituximab may also be used. Platelet transfusions are generally not recommended.About 1 per 100000 people are affected.

        "article": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens and is the cause of 60\u201370% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances symptoms can include problems with language disorientation (including easily getting lost) mood swings loss of motivation self-neglect and behavioral issues. As a person's condition declines they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually bodily functions are lost ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to twelve years.The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. There are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development. The strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of apolipoprotein E. Other risk factors include a history of head injury clinical depression and high blood pressure. The progress of the protein misfolding disease is largely associated with amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles and loss of neuronal connections in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal brain aging. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis but this can only take place after death.No treatments can stop or reverse its progression though some may temporarily improve symptoms. A healthy diet physical activity and social engagement are generally beneficial in ageing and may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's. Affected people become increasingly reliant on others for assistance often placing a burden on caregivers. The pressures can include social psychological physical and economic elements. Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes. Behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are sometimes treated with antipsychotics but this has an increased risk of early death. As of 2020 there were approximately 50 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease. It most often begins in people over 65\u00a0years of age although up to 10% of cases are early-onset impacting those in their 30s to mid-60s. It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older and women more often than men. The disease is named after German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer who first described it in 1906. Alzheimer's financial burden on society is large with an estimated global annual cost of US$1\u00a0trillion. It is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death worldwide."

Often no symptoms are noticed initially. As it progresses bone pain anemia kidney dysfunction and infections may occur. Complications may include hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. Risk factors include obesity radiation exposure family history age and certain chemicals. There is an increased risk of multiple myeloma in certain occupations. This is due to the occupational exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents having a role in causation of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma may develop from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that progresses to smoldering myeloma. The abnormal plasma cells produce abnormal antibodies which can cause kidney problems and overly thick blood. The plasma cells can also form a mass in the bone marrow or soft tissue. When one tumor is present it is called a plasmacytoma; more than one is called multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed based on blood or urine tests finding abnormal antibody proteins - (often using electrophoretic techniques revealing the presence of a monoclonal spike in the results - termed an m-spike) bone marrow biopsy finding cancerous plasma cells and medical imaging finding bone lesions. Another common finding is high blood calcium levels.Multiple myeloma is considered treatable but generally incurable. Remissions may be brought about with steroids chemotherapy targeted therapy and stem cell transplant. Bisphosphonates and radiation therapy are sometimes used to reduce pain from bone lesions.Globally about 175000 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2020 while about 117000 people died from the disease that year.  In the U.S. forecasts suggest about 35000 people will be diagnosed with the disease in 2023 and about 12000 people will die from the disease that year.  In 2020 there were an estimated 170405 people living with myeloma in the U.S.It is difficult to judge mortality statistics because treatments for the disease are advancing rapidly.  Based on data concerning people diagnosed with the disease between 2013 and 2019 about 60% lived five years or more post-diagnosis with about 34% living ten years or more.  People newly diagnosed with the disease now have a better outlook due to improved treatments.The disease usually occurs around the age of 60 and is more common in men than women. It is uncommon before the age of 40. The word myeloma is from Greek myelo- 'marrow' and -oma 'tumor'."

In most cases symptoms include fever chills loss of appetite nausea muscle pains\u2014particularly in the back\u2014and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within five days. In about 15% of people within a day of improving the fever comes back abdominal pain occurs and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased.The disease is caused by the yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. It infects humans other primates and several types of mosquitoes. In cities it is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti a type of mosquito found throughout the tropics and subtropics. The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus. The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses especially in the early stages. To confirm a suspected case blood-sample testing with a polymerase chain reaction is required.A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever exists and some countries require vaccinations for travelers. Other efforts to prevent infection include reducing the population of the transmitting mosquitoes. In areas where yellow fever is common early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population are important to prevent outbreaks. Once a person is infected management is symptomatic; no specific measures are effective against the virus. Death occurs in up to half of those who get severe disease.In 2013 yellow fever was estimated to have caused 130000 severe infections and 78000 deaths in Africa.  Approximately 90 percent of an estimated 200000 cases of yellow fever per year occur in Africa.  Nearly a billion people live in an area of the world where the disease is common. It is common in tropical areas of the continents of South America and Africa but not in Asia. Since the 1980s the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing. This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune more people living in cities people moving frequently and changing climate increasing the habitat for mosquitoes.The disease originated in Africa and spread to the Americas starting in the 17th century with the European trafficking of enslaved Africans from sub-Saharan Africa. Since the 17th century several major outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the Americas Africa and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries yellow fever was considered one of the most dangerous infectious diseases; numerous epidemics swept through major cities of the US and in other parts of the world.In 1927 yellow fever virus became the first human virus to be isolated."

Reducing pressure on the wound by taking weight off the foot has proven to be very effective in DFU treatment. DFUs are a major factor leading to lower leg amputations among the diabetic population in the US with 85% of amputations in diabetics being preceded by a DFU. Furthermore the five-year post-amputation mortality rate among diabetics is estimated at 45% for those with neuropathic DFUs.TCC has been used for off-loading DFUs in the US since the mid-1960s and is regarded by many practitioners as the \"reference standard\" for off-loading the bottom surface (sole) of the foot.TCC involves encasing the patient's complete foot including toes and the lower leg in a specialist cast that redistributes weight and pressure in the lower leg and foot during everyday movements. This redistributes pressure from the foot into the leg which is more able to bear weight to protect the wound letting it regenerate tissue and heal. TCC also keeps the ankle from rotating during walking which prevents shearing and twisting forces that can further damage the wound.Effective off-loading is a key treatment modality for DFUs particularly those where there is damage to the nerves in the feet (peripheral neuropathy). Along with infection management and vascular assessment TCC is vital aspect to effectively managing DFUs. TCC is the most effective and reliable method for off-loading DFUs."

        "article": "The Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) formally called Human gammaherpesvirus\u00a04 is one of the nine known human herpesvirus types in the herpes family and is one of the most common viruses in humans. EBV is a double-stranded DNA virus. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) is the first identified oncogenic virus which establishes permanent infection in humans. EBV causes infectious mononucleosis and is also tightly linked to many malignant diseases. Various vaccine formulations underwent testing in different animals or in humans. However none of them were able to prevent EBV infection and no vaccine has been approved to date.The virus causes infectious mononucleosis (\"mono\" or \"glandular fever\"). It is also associated with various non-malignant premalignant and malignant Epstein\u2013Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Hodgkin's lymphoma; non-lymphoid malignancies such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma; and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas. The virus is also associated with the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and acute cerebellar ataxia and by some evidence higher risks of developing certain autoimmune diseases especially dermatomyositis systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. About 200000 cancer cases globally per year are thought to be attributable to EBV. In 2022 a large study (population of 10 million over 20 years) suggested EBV as the leading cause of multiple sclerosis with a recent EBV infection causing a 32-fold increase in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis.Infection with EBV occurs by the oral transfer of saliva and genital secretions.Most people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States about half of all five-year-old children and about 90% of adults have evidence of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children who become infected with EBV display no symptoms or the symptoms are indistinguishable from the other mild brief illnesses of childhood. When infection occurs during adolescence or young adulthood it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50% of the time.EBV infects B cells of the immune system and epithelial cells. Once EBV's initial lytic infection is brought under control EBV latency persists in the individual's memory B cells for the rest of their life."

As a late complication of VZV infection Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 may develop in rare cases. VZV infections are species-specific to humans. The virus can survive in external environments for a few hours.VZV multiplies in the tonsils and causes a wide variety of symptoms. Similar to the herpes simplex viruses after primary infection with VZV (chickenpox) the virus lies dormant in neurons including the cranial nerve ganglia dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia.

GvHD is commonly associated with bone marrow transplants and stem cell transplants.White blood cells of the donor's immune system which remain within the donated tissue (the graft) recognize the recipient (the host) as foreign (non-self). The white blood cells present within the transplanted tissue then attack the recipient's body's cells which leads to GvHD. This should not be confused with a transplant rejection which occurs when the immune system of the transplant recipient rejects the transplanted tissue; GvHD occurs when the donor's immune system's white blood cells reject the recipient. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same but the details and course may differ. GvHD can also occur after a blood transfusion known as Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease or TA-GvHD if the blood products used have not been gamma irradiated or treated with an approved leukocyte reduction system. In contrast to organ/tissue transplant associated GvHD the incidence of TA-GvHD is increased with HLA matching (first-degree or close relatives)."

The graft contains donor T cells (T lymphocytes) that can be beneficial for the recipient by eliminating residual malignant cells. GvT might develop after recognizing tumor-specific or recipient-specific alloantigens. It could lead to remission or immune control of hematologic malignancies. This effect applies in myeloma and lymphoid leukemias lymphoma multiple myeloma and possibly breast cancer. It is closely linked with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) as the underlying principle of alloimmunity is the same. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) can be used to suppress GvHD without loss of beneficial GvT effect.The biology of GvT response is still not fully understood but it is probable that the reaction with polymorphic minor histocompatibility antigens expressed either specifically on hematopoietic cells or more widely on a number of tissue cells or tumor-associated antigens is involved. This response is mediated largely by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) but it can be employed by natural killers (NK cells) as separate effectors particularly in T-cell-depleted HLA-haploidentical HSCT."

Nowadays is it known that ATP acts a cotransmitter in most if not all nerves in the central and peripheral nervous system.Receptors for adenosine (called P1) and for ATP and ADP (called P2) were distinguished in 1978. Later the P2 receptors were subdivided into P2X and P2Y families based on their different mechanisms.

        "article": "Enterovirus is a genus of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses associated with several human and mammalian diseases. Enteroviruses are named by their transmission-route through the intestine ('enteric' meaning intestinal).Serologic studies have distinguished 71 human enterovirus serotypes on the basis of antibody neutralization tests. Additional antigenic variants have been defined within several of the serotypes on the basis of reduced or nonreciprocal cross-neutralization between variant strains. On the basis of their pathogenesis in humans and animals the enteroviruses were originally classified into four groups polioviruses Coxsackie A viruses (CA) Coxsackie B viruses (CB) and echoviruses but it was quickly realized that there were significant overlaps in the biological properties of viruses in the different groups. Enteroviruses isolated more recently are named with a system of consecutive numbers: EV-D68 EV-B69 EV-D70 EV-A71 etc. where genotyping is based on the VP1 capsid region.Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year and are often found in the respiratory secretions (e.g. saliva sputum or nasal mucus) and stool of an infected person. Historically poliomyelitis was the most significant disease caused by an enterovirus namely poliovirus. There are 81 non-polio and 3 polio enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans. Of the 81 non-polio types there are 22 Coxsackie A viruses 6 Coxsackie B viruses 28 echoviruses and 25 other enteroviruses.Poliovirus as well as coxsackie and echovirus is spread through the fecal\u2013oral route. Infection can result in a wide variety of symptoms including those of: mild respiratory illness (the common cold) hand foot and mouth disease acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis aseptic meningitis myocarditis severe neonatal sepsis-like disease acute flaccid paralysis and the related acute flaccid myelitis."

        "article": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) or hoof-and-mouth disease (HMD) is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals including domestic and wild bovids. The virus causes a high fever lasting two to six days followed by blisters inside the mouth and near the hoof that may rupture and cause lameness.FMD has very severe implications for animal farming since it is highly infectious and can be spread by infected animals comparatively easily through contact with contaminated farming equipment vehicles clothing and feed and by domestic and wild predators. Its containment demands considerable efforts in vaccination strict monitoring trade restrictions quarantines and the culling of both infected and healthy (uninfected) animals.Susceptible animals include cattle water buffalo sheep goats pigs antelope deer and bison. It has also been known to infect hedgehogs and elephants; llamas and alpacas may develop mild symptoms but are resistant to the disease and do not pass it on to others of the same species. In laboratory experiments mice rats and chickens have been artificially infected but they are not believed to contract the disease under natural conditions. Cattle Asian and African buffalo sheep and goats can become carriers following an acute infection meaning they are still infected with a small amount of virus but appear healthy. Animals can be carriers for up to 1\u20132 years and are considered very unlikely to infect other animals although laboratory evidence suggests that transmission from carriers is possible.Humans are only extremely rarely infected by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). (Humans particularly young children can be affected by hand foot and mouth disease (HFMDV) which is often confused for FMDV. Similarly HFMDV is a viral infection belonging to the Picornaviridae family but it is distinct from FMDV. HFMDV also affects cattle sheep and swine.)The virus responsible for FMD is an aphthovirus foot-and-mouth disease virus. Infection occurs when the virus particle is taken into a cell of the host. The cell is then forced to manufacture thousands of copies of the virus and eventually bursts releasing the new particles in the blood. The virus is genetically highly variable which limits the effectiveness of vaccination. The disease was first documented in 1870."

Because of the historical trauma the word \"leprosy\" invokes the disease is now referred to as Hansen's disease named after Gerhard Armauer Hansen who discovered Mycobacterium leprae the bacterial agent that causes Hansen's disease. Those who have suffered from Hansen's disease describe the impact of social stigma as far worse than the physical manifestations despite it being only mildly contagious and pharmacologically curable. This sentiment is echoed by Weis and Ramakrishna who noted that \"the impact of the meaning of the disease may be a greater source of suffering than symptoms of the disease\"."

This is likely due to gene deletion and decay that the genome of the species has experienced via reductive evolution which has caused the bacterium to depend heavily on its host for nutrients and metabolic intermediates. It has a narrow host range and apart from humans the only other natural hosts are nine-banded armadillo and red squirrels. The bacteria infect mainly macrophages and Schwann cells and are typically found congregated as a palisade.Mycobacterium leprae was sensitive to dapsone as a treatment alone but since the 1960's it has developed resistance against this antibiotic. Currently a multidrug treatment (MDT) is recommended by the World Health Organization including dapsone rifampicin and clofazimine. The species was discovered in 1873 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen and was the first bacterium to be identified as a cause of disease in humans."

This would be the case if the warm temperatures are outside the normal climate pattern for that area. High humidity often occurs during heat waves as well. This is especially the case in oceanic climate countries. Heat waves have become more frequent and more intense over land across almost every area on Earth since the 1950s. Heat waves occur from climate change.Heat waves form when a high-pressure area in the upper atmosphere strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks. This traps heat near the earth's surface. It is usually possible to detect heat waves by using forecasting instruments. This allows the authorities to issue a warning.Heat waves have an impact on the economy. They can reduce labour productivity disrupt agricultural and industrial processes and damage infrastructure. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures and thousands of deaths from hyperthermia. They have increased the risk of wildfires in areas with drought. They can lead to widespread electricity outages because more air conditioning is used. A heat wave counts as extreme weather. It poses danger to human health because heat and sunlight overwhelm the thermoregulation in humans."

The term \"maculopapular\" is a compound: macules are small flat discolored spots on the surface of the skin; and papules are small raised bumps. It is also described as erythematous or red.This type of rash is common in several diseases and medical conditions including scarlet fever measles Ebola virus disease rubella HIV secondary syphilis (Congenital syphilis which is asymptomatic the newborn may present this type of rash) erythrovirus (parvovirus B19) chikungunya (alphavirus) zika smallpox (which has been eradicated) varicella (when vaccinated persons exhibit symptoms from the modified form) heat rash and sometimes in Dengue fever. It is also a common manifestation of a skin reaction to the antibiotic amoxicillin or chemotherapy drugs.  Cutaneous infiltration of leukemic cells may also have this appearance. Maculopapular rash is seen in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) which can be seen within one week or several weeks after the transplant. In the case of GVHD the maculopapular lesions may progress to a condition similar to toxic epidermal necrolysis. In addition this is the type of rash that some patients presenting with Ebola virus hemorrhagic (EBO-Z) fever will reveal but can be hard to see on dark skin people. It is also seen in patients with Marburg hemorrhagic fever a filovirus not unlike Ebola.This type of rash can be as a result of large doses of niacin or no-flush niacin (2000 \u2013 2500\u00a0mg) used for the management of low HDL cholesterol.This type of rash can also be a symptom of Sea bather's eruption. This stinging pruritic maculopapular rash affects swimmers in some Atlantic locales (e.g. Florida Caribbean Long Island). It is caused by hypersensitivity to stings from the larvae of the sea anemone (e.g. Edwardsiella lineate) or the thimble jellyfish (Linuche unguiculata). The rash appears where the bathing suit contacts the skin.This type of rash can also be a symptom of acute arsenic intoxication appearing 2 weeks later."

Collagen XVII is a structural component of hemidesmosomes multiprotein complexes at the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone that mediate adhesion of keratinocytes to the underlying membrane. It also appears to be a key protein in maintaining the integrity of the corneal epithelium. Mutations in this gene are associated with both generalized atrophic benign and junctional epidermolysis bullosa as well as recurrent corneal erosions and expression of this gene is abnormal in various cancers. Two homotrimeric forms of type XVII collagen exist. The full length form is the transmembrane protein.

At physiological pH the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (\u2212CO2\u2212) and both the amino and guanidino groups are protonated resulting in a cation. Only the l-arginine (symbol Arg or R) enantiomer is found naturally. Arg residues are common components of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU CGC CGA CGG AGA and AGG. The guanidine group in arginine is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. Like all amino acids it is a white water-soluble solid.The one-letter symbol R was assigned to arginine for its phonetic similarity."

        "article": "Herpes simplex often known simply as herpes is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Herpes infections are categorized by the area of the body that is infected. The two major types of herpes are oral herpes and genital herpes though other forms also exist. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes involves the genitalia. It may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever muscle pains swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity.Herpetic whitlow typically involves the fingers or thumb herpes simplex keratitis involves the eye herpesviral encephalitis involves the brain and neonatal herpes involves any part of the body of a newborn among others.There are two types of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more commonly causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function stress and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.The most effective method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal oral manual and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk. Daily antiviral medication taken by someone who has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine may be used to help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.Worldwide rates of either HSV-1 or HSV-2 are between 60% and 95% in adults. HSV-1 is usually acquired during childhood. Since there is no cure for either HSV-1 or HSV-2 rates of both inherently increase as people age. Rates of HSV-1 are between 70% and 80% in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40% to 60% in populations of improved socioeconomic status. An estimated 536 million people worldwide (16% of the population) were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and those in the developing world. Most people with HSV-2 do not realize that they are infected."

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is the most common viral infection of the mouth.Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) represents the clinically apparent pattern of primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection since the vast majority of other primary infections are symptomless. PHGS is caused predominantly by HSV-1 and affects mainly children. Prodromal symptoms such as fever anorexia irritability malaise and headache may occur in advance of disease. The disease presents as numerous pin-head vesicles which rupture rapidly to form painful irregular ulcerations covered by yellow\u2013grey membranes.

An anal fistula connects the anal canal to the perianal skin. An anovaginal or rectovaginal fistula is a hole joining the anus or rectum to the vagina. A colovaginal fistula joins the  space in the colon to that in the vagina. A urinary tract fistula is an abnormal opening in the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ. An abnormal communication (i.e. hole or tube) between the bladder and the uterus is called a vesicouterine fistula while if it is between the bladder and the vagina it is known as a vesicovaginal fistula and if between the urethra and the vagina: a urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine it is known as an enteroenteral fistula between the small intestine and the skin as an enterocutaneous fistula and between the colon and the skin as a colocutaneous fistula.A fistula can result from an infection inflammation injury or surgery. Sometimes a fistula is  deliberately surgically created as part of a treatment for example in the case of an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis.The treatment for a fistula varies depending on the cause and extent of the fistula but often involves surgical intervention combined with antibiotic therapy. In some cases the fistula is temporarily covered using a fibrin glue or plug. A catheter may be required to drain a fistula.Globally every year between 50000 and 100000 women are affected by one or more fistulas relating to childbirth. In botany the term is most common in its adjectival forms where it is used in binomial names to refer to a species that is distinguished by one or more hollow or tubular structures. Monarda fistulosa for example has tubular flowers. The term was first used in the 14th century."

It is almost always used together with other antibiotics with two notable exceptions: when given as a \"preferred treatment that is strongly recommended\" for latent TB infection; and when used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal disease in people who have been exposed to those bacteria. Before treating a person for a long period of time measurements of liver enzymes and blood counts are recommended. Rifampicin may be given either by mouth or intravenously.Common side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea and loss of appetite. It often turns urine sweat and tears a red or orange color. Liver problems or allergic reactions may occur. It is part of the recommended treatment of active tuberculosis during pregnancy  though its safety in pregnancy is not known. Rifampicin is of the rifamycin group of antibiotics. It works by decreasing the production of RNA by bacteria.Rifampicin was discovered in 1965 marketed in Italy in 1968 and approved in the United States in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies rifampicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. Rifampicin is made by the soil bacterium Amycolatopsis rifamycinica."

It is formulated and used both alone and in combination with an estrogen. CPA is taken by mouth one to three times per day.Common side effects of high-dose CPA in men include gynecomastia (breast development) and feminization. In both men and women possible side effects of CPA include low sex hormone levels reversible infertility sexual dysfunction fatigue depression weight gain and elevated liver enzymes. At very high doses in older individuals significant cardiovascular complications can occur. Rare but serious adverse reactions of CPA include blood clots liver damage and brain tumors. CPA can also cause adrenal insufficiency as a withdrawal effect if it is discontinued abruptly from a high dosage. CPA blocks the effects of androgens such as testosterone in the body which it does by preventing them from interacting with their biological target the androgen receptor (AR) and by reducing their production by the gonads hence their concentrations in the body. In addition it has progesterone-like effects by activating the progesterone receptor (PR). It can also produce weak cortisol-like effects at very high doses.CPA was discovered in 1961. It was originally developed as a progestin. In 1965 the antiandrogenic effects of CPA were discovered. CPA was first marketed as an antiandrogen in 1973 and was the first antiandrogen to be introduced for medical use. A few years later in 1978 CPA was introduced as a progestin in a birth control pill. It has been described as a \"first-generation\" progestin and as the prototypical antiandrogen. CPA is available widely throughout the world. An exception is the United States where it is not approved for use."

Symptoms of hyperandrogenism may include acne seborrhea hair loss on the scalp increased body or facial hair and infrequent or absent menstruation. Complications may include high blood cholesterol and diabetes. It occurs in approximately 5% of women of reproductive age.Polycystic ovary syndrome accounts for about 70% of hyperandrogenism cases. Other causes include Congenital adrenal hyperplasia insulin resistance hyperprolactinemia Cushing's disease certain types of cancers and certain medications. Diagnosis often involves blood tests for testosterone 17-hydroxyprogesterone and prolactin as well as a pelvic ultrasound.Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Symptoms of hyperandrogenism can be treated with birth control pills or antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. Other measures may include hair removal techniques.The earliest known description of the condition is attributed to Hippocrates.In 2011 the International Association of Athletics Federations (now World Athletics) and IOC (International Olympic Committee) released statements restricting the eligibility of female athletes with high testosterone whether through hyperandrogenism or as a result of a difference in sex development (DSD). These regulations were referred to by both bodies as hyperandrogenism regulations and have led to athletes with DSDs being described as having hyperandrogenism. They were revised in 2019 to focus more specifically on DSDs."

Though the word beehive is used to describe the nest of any bee colony scientific and professional literature distinguishes nest from hive. Nest is used to discuss colonies that house themselves in natural or artificial cavities or are hanging and exposed. The term hive is used to describe an artificial/man-made structure to house a honey bee nest. Several species of Apis live in colonies. But for honey production the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana) are the main species kept in hives.The nest's internal structure is a densely packed group of hexagonal prismatic cells made of beeswax called a honeycomb. The bees use the cells to store food (honey and pollen) and to house the brood (eggs larvae and pupae).Beehives serve several purposes. These include the production of honey pollination of nearby crops housing supply bees for apitherapy treatment and trying to mitigate the effects of colony collapse disorder. In America hives are commonly transported so bees can pollinate crops elsewhere. Several patents have been issued for beehive designs."

Honey bees in the genus Apis are the most commonly kept species but other honey producing bees such as Melipona stingless bees are also kept. Beekeepers (or apiarists) keep bees to collect honey and other products of the hive: beeswax propolis bee pollen and royal jelly. Other sources of beekeeping income include pollination of crops raising queens and production of package bees for sale. Bee hives are kept in an apiary or \"bee yard\".The keeping of bees by humans primarily for honey production began around 10000 years ago. A sample of 5500-year-old honey was unearthed from the grave of a noblewoman during archaeological excavations in 2003 near the town of Borjomi Georgia. Ceramic jars found in the grave contained several types of honey including linden and flower honey. Domestication of bees can be seen in Egyptian art from around 4500 years ago; there is also evidence of beekeeping in ancient China Greece and Maya.In the modern era beekeeping is often used for crop pollination and the collection of byproducts such as wax and propolis. The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses but many small beekeeping operations are run as a hobby. As beekeeping technology has advanced beekeeping has become more accessible and urban beekeeping was described as a growing trend as of 2016. Some studies have found city-kept bees are healthier than those in rural settings because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity in cities."

The patches of rash may appear on different body parts with variable duration from minutes to days and does not leave any long-lasting skin change. Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks (a condition known as chronic urticaria). The condition frequently recurs.Hives frequently occur following an infection or as a result of an allergic reaction such as to medication insect bites or food. Psychological stress cold temperature or vibration may also be a trigger. In half of cases the cause remains unknown. Risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma. Diagnosis is typically based on appearance. Patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy.Prevention is by avoiding whatever it is that causes the condition. Treatment is typically with antihistamines with the second generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine loratadine and cetirizine being preferred due to less risk of sedation and cognitive impairment. In refractory cases corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors may also be used. Keeping the environmental temperature cool is also useful. For cases that last more than six weeks long term antihistamine therapy is indicated. Immunosuppressants such as omalizumab or cyclosporin may also be used.About 20% of people are affected at some point in their lives. Cases of short duration occur equally in males and females while cases of long duration are more common in females. Cases of short duration are more common among children while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged. Hives have been described at least since the time of Hippocrates.

Because acne is generally a disorder of the pilosebaceous units caused by hormones the medications that trigger acne medicamentosa most frequently are hormone analogs. It is also often caused by corticosteroids; in this case it is referred to as steroid acne.Although the masculinizing hormone testosterone is most often blamed and although men with acne secondary to bodybuilding hormones are seen from time to time the major hormonal medications that cause acne are the progestin analogues present in hormonal contraception. Other medications can produce acneiform eruptions (usually pimply bumps and pustules that look like acne).Some conditions mimic acne medicamentosa. The most common mimic is folliculitis produced by an overgrowth of the Malassezia species often secondary to oral or systemic corticosteroids or secondary to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as the tetracycline family used in acne. This is often misinterpreted as 'tetracycline-resistant acne'."

Effects of menopause can include symptoms such as hot flashes accelerated skin aging vaginal dryness decreased muscle mass and complications such as osteoporosis (bone loss) sexual dysfunction and vaginal atrophy. They are mostly caused by low levels of female sex hormones (e.g. estrogens) that occur during menopause.Estrogens and progestogens are the main hormone drugs used in HRT. Progesterone is the main female sex hormone that occurs naturally and is also manufactured into a drug that is used in menopausal hormone therapy. Although both classes of hormones can have symptomatic benefit progestogen is specifically added to estrogen regimens unless the uterus has been removed to avoid the increased risk of endometrial cancer. Unopposed estrogen therapy promotes endometrial hyperplasia and increases the risk of cancer while progestogen reduces this risk. Androgens like testosterone are sometimes used as well. HRT is available through a variety of different routes.The long-term effects of HRT on most organ systems vary by age and time since the last physiological exposure to hormones and there can be large differences in individual regimens factors which have made analyzing effects difficult. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is an ongoing study of over 27000 women that began in 1991 with the most recent analyses suggesting that when initiated within 10 years of menopause HRT reduces all-cause mortality and risks of coronary disease osteoporosis and dementia; after 10 years the beneficial effects on mortality and coronary heart disease are no longer apparent though there are decreased risks of hip and vertebral fractures and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism when taken orally.\"Bioidentical\" hormone replacement is a development in the 21st century and uses manufactured compounds with \"exactly the same chemical and molecular structure as hormones that are produced in the human body.\" These are mainly steroids derived from plants and can be a component of either registered pharmaceutical or custom-made compounded preparations with the latter generally not recommended by regulatory bodies due to their lack of standardization and formal oversight. Bioidentical hormone replacement has inadequate clinical research to determine its safety and efficacy as of 2017.The current indications for use from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms such as vasomotor hot flashes or vaginal atrophy and prevention of osteoporosis."

Pubic hair differs from other hair on the body and is a secondary sex characteristic. Many cultures regard pubic hair as erotic and in most cultures it is associated with the genitals which both men and women are expected to keep covered at all times. In some cultures it is the norm for pubic hair to be removed especially of females; the practice is regarded as part of personal hygiene. In other cultures the exposure of pubic hair (for example when wearing a swimsuit) may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing and is therefore trimmed or otherwise styled to avoid it being visible.

As a simple \"classical\" style free from aristocratic excess it was associated with the French Revolution and popular among those who supported it. Although initially a men's style it was soon adopted by women as well. The Journal de Paris reported in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig \u00e0 la Titus.\" The style spread to England as well where it was often called coiffure \u00e0 la guillotine in reference to the beheadings of the French Revolution.

The HPV strains that Gardasil protects against are sexually transmitted specifically HPV types 6 11 16 and 18. HPV types 16 and 18 cause an estimated 70% of cervical cancers and are responsible for most HPV-induced anal vulvar vaginal and penile cancer cases. HPV types 6 and 11 cause an estimated 90% of genital warts cases. HPV type 16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers and the prevalence is higher in males than females. Though Gardasil does not treat existing infection vaccination is still recommended for HPV-positive individuals as it may protect against one or more different strains of the disease.The vaccine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2006 initially for use in females aged 9\u201326. In 2007 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended Gardasil for routine vaccination of girls aged 11 and 12 years. As of August 2009 vaccination was recommended for both males and females before adolescence and the beginning of potential sexual activity. By 2011 the vaccine had been approved in 120 other countries.In 2014 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a nine-valent version Gardasil 9 to protect against infection with the strains covered by the first generation of Gardasil as well as five other HPV strains responsible for 20% of cervical cancers (types 31 33 45 52 and 58). In 2018 the FDA approved expanded use of Gardasil 9 for individuals 27 to 45 years old."

It is estimated that HPV vaccines may prevent 70% of cervical cancer 80% of anal cancer 60% of vaginal cancer 40% of vulvar cancer and show more than 90% efficacy in preventing HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. They additionally prevent some genital warts with the quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines that protect against HPV types HPV-6 and HPV-11 providing greater protection.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HPV vaccines as part of routine vaccinations in all countries along with other prevention measures. The vaccines require two or three doses depending on a person's age and immune status. Vaccinating girls around the ages of nine to thirteen is typically recommended. The vaccines provide protection for at least 5 to 10 years. Cervical cancer screening is still required following vaccination. Vaccinating a large portion of the population may also benefit the unvaccinated.HPV vaccines are very safe. Pain at the site of injection occurs in about 80% of people. Redness and swelling at the site and fever may also occur. No link to Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been found.The first HPV vaccine became available in 2006.

The most common types of head and neck cancer occur in the lips mouth and larynx. Symptoms predominantly include a sore that does not heal or a change in the voice. In those with advanced disease there may be unusual bleeding facial pain numbness or swelling and visible lumps on the outside of the neck or oral cavity. Given the location of these cancers it is possible for an afflicted individual to experience difficulty breathing. The majority of head and neck cancer is caused by the use of alcohol or tobacco including smokeless tobacco with increasing cases linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV). Other risk factors include the Epstein\u2013Barr virus betel quid radiation exposure and certain workplace exposures. About 90% are pathologically classified as squamous cell cancers. The diagnosis is confirmed by a tissue biopsy. The degree of surrounding tissue invasion and distant spread may be determined by medical imaging and blood tests.Not using tobacco or alcohol can reduce the risk of head and neck cancer. The HPV vaccine may reduce the lifetime risk of oral cancer if taken prior to the onset of sexual activity but confirmation will likely not be known until around 2060. This is because oropharyngeal cancer typically presents in the 4th\u20136th decade of life and this is a relatively new vaccine. While screening in the general population does not appear to be useful screening high-risk groups by examination of the throat might be useful. Head and neck cancer is often curable if it is diagnosed early; however outcomes are typically poor if it is diagnosed late. Treatment may include a combination of surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Previous diagnosis and treatment of a head and neck cancer confer a higher risk of developing a second head and neck cancer or recurrence.Globally head and neck cancer accounts for 650000 new cases of cancer and 330000 deaths annually on average. In 2018 it was the seventh most common cancer worldwide with 890000 new cases documented and 450000 people dying from the disease. In the United States head and neck cancer makes up 3% of all cancer cases (averaging 53000 new diagnoses per year) and 1.5% of cancer deaths. The 2017 worldwide figure cites head and neck cancers as representing 5.3% of all cancers (not including non-melanoma skin cancers).  Notably head and neck cancer secondary to chronic alcohol or tobacco use has been steadily declining as less of the population chronically smokes tobacco. However HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer is rising particularly in younger people in westernized nations which is thought to be reflective of changes in oral sexual practices specifically with regard to the number of oral sexual partners. This increase since the 1970s has mostly affected wealthier nations and male populations. This is due to evidence suggesting that transmission rates of HPV from women to men are higher than from men to women as women often have a higher immune response to infection.The usual age at diagnosis is between 55 and 65 years old. The average 5-year survival following diagnosis in the developed world is 42\u201364%."

When on the lips it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing new lumps or bumps in the neck a swelling in the mouth or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips.Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use. Those who use both alcohol and tobacco have a 15 times greater risk of oral cancer than those who use neither. Other risk factors include HPV infection chewing paan and sun exposure on the lower lip. Oral cancer is a subgroup of head and neck cancers. Diagnosis is made by biopsy of the concerning area followed by investigation with CT scan MRI PET scan and examination to determine if it has spread to distant parts of the body.Oral cancer can be prevented by avoiding tobacco products limiting alcohol use sun protection on the lower lip HPV vaccination and avoidance of paan. Treatments used for oral cancer can include a combination of surgery (to remove the tumor and regional lymph nodes) radiation therapy chemotherapy or targeted therapy.  The types of treatments will depend on the size locations and spread of the cancer taken into consideration with the general health of the person.In 2018 oral cancer occurred globally in about 355000 people and resulted in 177000 deaths. Between 1999 and 2015 in the United States the rate of oral cancer increased 6% (from 10.9 to 11.6 per 100000). Deaths from oral cancer during this time decreased 7% (from 2.7 to 2.5 per 100000). Oral cancer has an overall 5 year survival rate of 65% in the United States as of 2015. This varies from 84% if diagnosed when localized compared to 66% if it has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck and 39% if it has spread to distant parts of the body.

Several hundred species of papillomaviruses traditionally referred to as \"types\" have been identified infecting all carefully inspected mammals but also other vertebrates such as birds snakes turtles and fish. Infection by most papillomavirus types depending on the type is either asymptomatic (e.g. most Beta-PVs) or causes small benign tumors known as papillomas or warts (e.g. human papillomavirus 1 HPV6 or HPV11). Papillomas caused by some types however such as human papillomaviruses 16 and 18 carry a risk of becoming cancerous.Papillomaviruses are usually considered as highly host- and tissue-tropic and are thought to rarely be transmitted between species. Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues. All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals anus mouth or airways. For example human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands where they may cause warts. Additionally there are descriptions of the presence of papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Papillomaviruses were first identified in the early 20th century when it was shown that skin warts or papillomas could be transmitted between individuals by a filterable infectious agent. In 1935 Francis Peyton Rous who had previously demonstrated the existence of a cancer-causing sarcoma virus in chickens went on to show that a papillomavirus could cause skin cancer in infected rabbits. This was the first demonstration that a virus could cause cancer in mammals."

Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.Treatment is only needed if it is causing symptoms. This may include salicylic acid cryotherapy chemo-based fluorouracil or bleomycin and surgical removal. The skin atop the lesion should generally be removed before treatment. In about a third to two-thirds of cases they go away without specific treatment but this may take a few years.

This is a very common occurrence during the menopausal transition years. Over 80% of women experience hot flashes which may include excessive sweating during menopause.Night sweats range from being relatively harmless to a sign of underlying disease. Night sweats may happen because the sleep environment is too warm either because the bedroom is unusually hot or because there are too many covers on the bed.  Night sweats have been associated with a long list of clinical conditions. However there is very little evidence that supports clinical recommendations for this condition."

It works similar to tolterodine darifenacin and solifenacin although it is usually preferred over these medications. It is sometimes used off-label for treatment of hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating. It has also been used off-label to treat bed wetting in children but this use has declined as it is most likely ineffective in this role. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin.Common side effects include dry mouth constipation dizziness trouble sleeping and urinary tract infections. Serious side effects may include urinary retention and an increased risk of heat stroke. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied while use in breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is an antimuscarinic and works by blocking the effects of acetylcholine on smooth muscle.Oxybutynin was approved for medical use in the US in 1975. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021 it was the 102nd most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 6\u00a0million prescriptions."

        "article": "Perspiration also known as sweat is the fluid secreted by sweat glands in the skin of mammals.Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands. The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body and are responsible for secreting the watery brackish sweat most often triggered by excessive body temperature. Apocrine sweat glands are restricted to the armpits and a few other areas of the body and produce an odorless oily opaque secretion which then gains its characteristic odor from bacterial decomposition.In humans sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2\u20134 litres (0.53\u20131.06\u00a0US\u00a0gal) per hour or 10\u201314 litres (2.6\u20133.7\u00a0US\u00a0gal) per day but is less in children prior to puberty. Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling. Hence in hot weather or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion more sweat is produced. Animals with few sweat glands such as dogs accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx.Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals relatively few (apart from humans horses some primates and some bovidae) produce sweat in order to cool down. In horses such cooling sweat is created by apocrine glands and contains a wetting agent the protein latherin so it transfers from the skin to the surface of their coats."

The skin forms large diamond/trapezoid/rectangle-shaped plates that are separated by deep cracks. These affect the shape of the eyelids nose mouth and ears and limit movement of the arms and legs. Restricted movement of the chest can lead to breathing difficulties. These plates fall off over several weeks. Other complications can include premature birth infection problems with body temperature and dehydration. The condition is the most severe form of ichthyosis (except for syndromes that include ichthyosis for example Neu\u2013Laxova syndrome) a group of genetic disorders characterised by scaly skin.Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by mutations in the ABCA12 gene. This gene codes for a protein necessary for transporting lipids out of cells in the outermost layer of skin. The disorder is autosomal recessive and inherited from parents who are carriers. Diagnosis is often based on appearance at birth and confirmed by genetic testing. Before birth amniocentesis or ultrasound may support the diagnosis.There is no cure for the condition. Early in life constant supportive care is typically required. Treatments may include moisturizing cream antibiotics etretinate or retinoids. Around half of those affected die within the first few months; however retinoid treatment can increase chances of survival. Children who survive the first year of life often have long-term problems such as red skin joint contractures and delayed growth. The condition affects around 1 in 300000 births. It was first documented in a diary entry by Reverend Oliver Hart in America in 1750."

The biliary atresia phenotype caused by congenital aflatoxicosis in GST M1 deficient neonates is named Kotb disease. Syndromic biliary atresia (e.g. Biliary Atresia Splenic Malformation (BASM)) has been associated with certain genes (e.g. Polycystic Kidney Disease 1 Like 1 - PKD1L1) and some infants with isolated biliary atresia may arise as a result of an autoimmune inflammatory response possibly due to a viral infection of the liver soon after birth. In animals plant toxins have been shown to cause biliary atresia. The only effective treatments are operations such as the Kasai procedure and liver transplantation."

Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) poor appetite vomiting tiredness abdominal pain and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own progress to chronic hepatitis or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) liver failure and liver cancer.Hepatitis is most commonly caused by the virus hepatovirus A B C D and E. Other viruses can also cause liver inflammation including cytomegalovirus Epstein\u2013Barr virus and yellow fever virus. Other common causes of hepatitis include heavy alcohol use certain medications toxins other infections autoimmune diseases and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth and spread through infected blood. Hepatitis C is commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B.Hepatitis A B and D are preventable with immunization. Medications may be used to treat chronic viral hepatitis. Antiviral medications are recommended in all with chronic hepatitis C except those with conditions that limit their life expectancy. There is no specific treatment for NASH; physical activity a healthy diet and weight loss are recommended. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system. A liver transplant may be an option in both acute and chronic liver failure.Worldwide in 2015 hepatitis A occurred in about 114 million people chronic hepatitis B affected about 343 million people and chronic hepatitis C about 142 million people. In the United States NASH affects about 11 million people and alcoholic hepatitis affects about 5 million people. Hepatitis results in more than a million deaths a year most of which occur indirectly from liver scarring or liver cancer. In the United States hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths. The word is derived from the Greek h\u00eapar (\u1f27\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1) meaning \"liver\" and -itis (-\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2) meaning \"inflammation\"."

It can cause a number of symptoms such as poor ability to tolerate cold extreme fatigue muscle aches constipation slow heart rate  depression and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.Worldwide too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine. Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland certain medications a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism when suspected can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.Salt iodization has prevented hypothyroidism in many populations. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism. Medical professionals adjust the dose according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. Although an adequate amount of dietary iodine is important too much may worsen specific forms of hypothyroidism.Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine-deficient; however it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3\u20130.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level is thought to occur in 4.3\u20138.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism as are cats and horses albeit more rarely. The word hypothyroidism is from  Greek hypo- 'reduced'  thyreos 'shield' and eidos 'form'."

        "article": "Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a type of hearing loss in which the root cause lies in the inner ear sensory organ (cochlea and associated structures) or the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII).  SNHL accounts for about 90% of reported hearing loss . SNHL is usually permanent and can be mild moderate severe profound or total. Various other descriptors can be used depending on the shape of the audiogram such as high frequency low frequency U-shaped notched peaked or flat.Sensory hearing loss often occurs as a consequence of damaged or deficient cochlear hair cells. Hair cells may be abnormal at birth or damaged during the lifetime of an individual. There are both external causes of damage including infection and ototoxic drugs as well as intrinsic causes including genetic mutations. A common cause or exacerbating factor in SNHL is prolonged exposure to environmental noise or noise-induced hearing loss. Exposure to a single very loud noise such as a gun shot or bomb blast can cause noise-induced hearing loss. Using headphones at high volume over time or being in loud environments regularly such as a loud workplace sporting events concerts and using noisy machines can also be a risk for noise-induced hearing loss.Neural or \"retrocochlear\" hearing loss occurs because of damage to the cochlear nerve (CVIII). This damage may affect the initiation of the nerve impulse in the cochlear nerve or the transmission of the nerve impulse along the nerve into the brainstem.Most cases of SNHL present with a gradual deterioration of hearing thresholds occurring over years to decades. In some the loss may eventually affect large portions of the frequency range. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and dizziness or lightheadedness (vertigo). The most common kind of sensorineural hearing loss is age-related (presbycusis) followed by noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).Frequent symptoms of SNHL are loss of acuity in distinguishing foreground voices against noisy backgrounds difficulty understanding on the telephone some kinds of sounds seeming excessively loud or shrill difficulty understanding some parts of speech (fricatives and sibilants) loss of directionality of sound (especially with high frequency sounds) perception that people mumble when speaking and difficulty understanding speech. Similar symptoms are also associated with other kinds of hearing loss; audiometry or other diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish sensorineural hearing loss.Identification of sensorineural hearing loss is usually made by performing a pure tone audiometry (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. Tympanometry and speech audiometry may be helpful. Testing is performed by an audiologist.There is no proven or recommended treatment or cure for SNHL; management of hearing loss is usually by hearing strategies and hearing aids. In cases of profound or total deafness a cochlear implant is a specialised device that may restore a functional level of hearing. SNHL is at least partially preventable by avoiding environmental noise ototoxic chemicals and drugs and head trauma and treating or inoculating against certain triggering diseases and conditions like meningitis."

It accounts for 30% of cases of impetigo the other 70% being non-bullous impetigo.The bullae are caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus that cause the connections between cells in the uppermost layer of the skin to fall apart. Bullous impetigo in newborns children or adults who are immunocompromised and/or are experiencing kidney failure can develop into a more severe and generalized form called staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). The mortality rate is less than 3% for infected children but up to 60% in adults."

Once inside the body the bacteria may spread to a number of body systems and organs including the heart where the toxins produced by the bacteria may cause cardiac arrest.  Once the bacterium has been identified as the cause of the illness treatment is often in the form of antibiotics and where possible drainage of the infected area.  However many strains of this bacterium have become antibiotic resistant; for those with these kinds of infection the body's own immune system is the only defense against the disease.  If that system is weakened or compromised the disease may progress rapidly.  Anyone can contract staph but pregnant women children and people with chronic diseases or who are immuno-deficient are often more susceptible to contracting an infection."

        "article": "Essential tremor (ET) also called benign tremor familial tremor and idiopathic tremor is a medical condition characterized by involuntary rhythmic contractions and relaxations (oscillations or twitching movements) of certain muscle groups in one or more body parts of unknown cause. It is typically symmetrical and affects the arms hands or fingers; but sometimes involves the head vocal cords or other body parts.  Essential tremor is either an action (intention) tremor\u2014it intensifies when one tries to use the affected muscles during voluntary movements such as eating and writing\u2014or it is a postural tremor present with sustained muscle tone. This means that it is distinct from a resting tremor such as that caused by Parkinson's disease which is not correlated with movement.Essential tremor is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common movement disorder. Its onset is usually after age 40 but it can occur at any age. The cause is unknown. Diagnosis is by observing the typical pattern of the tremor coupled with the exclusion of known causes of such a tremor.While essential tremor is distinct from Parkinson's disease which causes a resting tremor essential tremor is nevertheless sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease. Some patients have been found to have both essential tremors and resting tremors.Treatments for essential tremor include medications typically given sequentially to determine which provides the best compromise between effectiveness and troublesome side effects. Clostridium botulinum toxin (Botox) injections and ultrasound are also sometimes used for cases refractory to medications."

Despite its designation as a hemangioma a cavernous hemangioma is not a tumor as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia.

The mortality rate of diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is 50-90%. This disease is normally found in female Caucasian infants. The most common site of internal organ damage or lesions is the liver which can redirect blood away from the heart and cause arteriovenous shunting. This can cause high cardiac output leading to further complications such as congestive heart failure. This condition affecting the liver is also known as infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH). Other sites of internal organ damage can include the intestines nervous system lungs and sometimes the skeletal system. Early detection and treatment with steroids results in most newborn babies with this disease remaining healthy with serious problems developing for some individuals during the hemangioma's growth phase."

A hemangioma can occur anywhere on the body but most commonly appears on the face scalp chest or back. They tend to grow for up to a year before gradually shrinking as the child gets older. A hemangioma may need to be treated if it interferes with vision or breathing or is likely to cause long-term disfigurement. In rare cases internal hemangiomas can cause or contribute to other medical problems. They usually disappear in 10 years.  The first line treatment option is beta blockers which are highly effective in the majority of cases.

Some individuals may feel tired or have a fever. Typically uncovered areas of the body are affected. Their bites are not known to transmit any infectious disease. Complications may rarely include areas of dead skin or vasculitis.Bed bug bites are caused primarily by two species of insects: Cimex lectularius (the common bed bug) and Cimex hemipterus found primarily in the tropics. Their size ranges between 1 and 7\u00a0mm. They spread by crawling between nearby locations or by being carried within personal items. Infestation is rarely due to a lack of hygiene but is more common in high-density areas. Diagnosis involves both finding the bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms. Bed bugs spend much of their time in dark hidden locations like mattress seams or cracks in a wall.Treatment is directed towards the symptoms. Eliminating bed bugs from the home is often difficult partly because bed bugs can survive up to approximately 300 days without feeding. Repeated treatments of a home may be required. These treatments may include heating the room to 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F) for more than 90 minutes frequent vacuuming washing clothing at high temperatures and the use of various pesticides.Fossils found in Egypt show bed bugs have been known as human parasites for at least 3500 years. Despite being nearly eradicated in developed countries after World War II infestations have increased since the 1990s and bed bugs are now relatively common in all regions of the globe. Experts point to several factors that have contributed to the explosion in infestations over the last three decades: increased immigration and international travel; expanded markets for second-hand goods; a greater focus on control of other pests; the banning of certain pesticides and increased resistance to pesticides still in use."

        "article": "Mosquitoes the Culicidae are a family of small flies consisting of 3600 species. The word mosquito (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito) is Spanish and Portuguese for little fly. Mosquitoes have a slender segmented body one pair of wings three pairs of long hair-like legs and specialized highly elongated piercing-sucking mouthparts. All mosquitoes drink nectar from flowers; females of some species have in addition adapted to drink blood. Evolutionary biologists view mosquitoes as micropredators small animals that parasitise larger ones by drinking their blood without immediately killing them. Medical parasitologists view mosquitoes instead as vectors of disease carrying protozoan parasites or bacterial or viral pathogens from one host to another.The mosquito life cycle consists of four stages: egg larva pupa and adult. Eggs are laid on the water surface; they hatch into motile larvae that feed on aquatic algae and organic material. These larvae are important food sources for many freshwater animals such as dragonfly nymphs many fish and some birds. Adult females of many species have mouthparts adapted to pierce the skin of a host and feed on blood of a wide range of vertebrate hosts and some invertebrates primarily other arthropods. Some species only produce eggs after a blood meal.The mosquito's saliva is transferred to the host during the bite and can cause an itchy rash. In addition blood-feeding species can ingest pathogens while biting and transmit them to other hosts. Those species include vectors of parasitic diseases such as malaria and filariasis and arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever. By transmitting diseases mosquitoes cause the deaths of over 725000 people each year."

It typically causes more than one of the following: an itchy rash throat closing due to swelling that can obstruct or stop breathing; severe tongue swelling that can also interfere with or stop breathing; shortness of breath vomiting lightheadedness loss of consciousness low blood pressure and medical shock. These symptoms typically start in minutes to hours and then increase very rapidly to life-threatening levels. Urgent medical treatment is required to prevent serious harm and death even if the patient has used an epipen or has taken other medications in response and even if symptoms appear to be improving.Common causes include allergies to insect bites and stings allergies to foods \u2013 including nuts milk fish shellfish eggs and some fresh fruits or dried fruits; allergies to sulfites \u2013 a class of food preservatives and a byproduct in some fermented foods like vinegar; allergies to medications \u2013 including some antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin; allergy to general anaesthetic (used to make people sleep during surgery); allergy to contrast agents \u2013 dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of the body show up better on scans; allergy to latex \u2013 a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms. Other causes can include physical exercise and cases may also occur in some people due to escalating reactions to simple throat irritation or may also occur without an obvious reason. The mechanism involves the release of inflammatory mediators in a rapidly escalating cascade from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms. Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen or irritant and in some cases reaction to physical exercise.The primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle intravenous fluids then placing the person \"in a reclining position with feet elevated to help restore normal blood flow\". Additional doses of epinephrine may be required. Other measures such as antihistamines and steroids are complementary. Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector commonly called an \"epipen\" and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis. Immediately contacting ambulance / EMT services is always strongly recommended regardless of any on site treatment. Getting to a doctor or hospital as soon as possible is absolutely required in all cases even if it appears to be getting better.Worldwide 0.05\u20132% of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life. Globally as underreporting declined into the 2010s the rate appeared to be increasing. It occurs most often in young people and females. About 99.7% of people hospitalized with anaphylaxis in the United States survive."

It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. It is given by injection.Side effects may be severe. They include serum sickness shortness of breath and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified.Versions are available for spider bites snake bites fish stings and scorpion stings. Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored. One such different method of production involves production from bacteria. Another approach is to develop targeted drugs (which unlike antibodies are usually synthetic and easier to manufacture at scale).Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines."

They are caused by infection with a variety of pathogens including rickettsia and other types of bacteria viruses and protozoa.The economic impact of tick-borne diseases is considered to be substantial in humans and tick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80\u200a% of cattle worldwide. Most of these pathogens require passage through vertebrate hosts as part of their life cycle. Tick-borne infections in humans farm animals and companion animals are primarily associated with wildlife animal reservoirs. Many tick-borne infections in humans involve a complex cycle between wildlife animal reservoirs and tick vectors. The survival and transmission of these tick-borne viruses are closely linked to their interactions with tick vectors and host cells. These viruses are classified into different families including Asfarviridae Reoviridae Rhabdoviridae Orthomyxoviridae Bunyaviridae and Flaviviridae.The occurrence of ticks and tick-borne illnesses in humans is increasing. Tick populations are spreading into new areas in part due to climate change. Tick populations are also affected by changes in the populations of their hosts (e.g. deer cattle mice lizards) and those hosts' predators (e.g. foxes).  Diversity and availability of hosts and predators can be affected by deforestation and habitat fragmentation.Because individual ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. As the incidence of tick-borne illnesses increases and the geographic areas in which they are found expand health workers increasingly must be able to distinguish the diverse and often overlapping clinical presentations of these diseases.As of 2020  18 tick-borne pathogens have been identified in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and at least 27 are known globally. New tick-borne diseases have been discovered in the 21st century due in part to the use of molecular assays and next-generation sequencing."

The fibronectin protein is produced from a single gene but alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA leads to the creation of several isoforms.Two types of fibronectin are present in vertebrates:soluble plasma fibronectin (formerly called \"cold-insoluble globulin\" or CIg) is a major protein component of blood plasma (300 \u03bcg/ml) and is produced in the liver by hepatocytes.insoluble cellular fibronectin is a major component of the extracellular matrix. It is secreted by various cells primarily fibroblasts as a soluble protein dimer and is then assembled into an insoluble matrix in a complex cell-mediated process.Fibronectin plays a major role in cell adhesion growth migration and differentiation and it is important for processes such as wound healing and embryonic development.

It typically occurs in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth intestines or eye (uveal melanoma). In women melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men on the back.   Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma. However the medical community stresses that there is no such thing as a 'benign melanoma' and recommends that the term 'malignant melanoma' should be avoided as redundant. About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include  increase\u2014especially rapid increase\u2014in size irregular edges change in color itchiness or skin breakdown.The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. The UV light may be from the sun or other sources such as tanning devices. Those with many moles a history of affected family members and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase the risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.Avoiding UV light and using sunscreen in UV-bright sun conditions may prevent melanoma. Treatment typically is removal by surgery of the melanoma and the potentially affected adjacent tissue bordering the melanoma. In those with slightly larger cancers nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread (metastasis). Most people are cured if metastasis has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread immunotherapy biologic therapy radiation therapy or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States are 99% among those with localized disease 65% when the disease has spread to lymph nodes and 25% among those with distant spread. The likelihood that melanoma will reoccur or spread depends on its thickness how fast the cells are dividing and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down.Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally in 2012 it newly occurred in 232000 people. In 2015 3.1 million people had active disease which resulted in 59800 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. High rates also occur in Northern Europe and North America while it is less common in Asia Africa and Latin America. In the United States melanoma occurs about 1.6 times more often in men than women. Melanoma has become more common since the 1960s in areas mostly populated by people of European descent."

This cancer typically develops in individuals as a single cutaneous tumor in the intraepidermal spiral part (termed the acrosyringium) of these sweat glands' ducts (i.e. channels) at or near to where they open on the skin's surface. PCA tumors are classified as one form of the cutaneous adnexal tumors; in a study of 2205 cases PCA was the most common (11.8%) form of these tumors.Porocarcinomas are malignant counterparts to the far more common benign tumors of the eccrine sweat gland's acrosyringium i.e. poromas. As currently viewed there are 4 poroma variants based on their predominant cell types and extent of their tumor tissues presence in the epidermis and dermis: 1) Hidroacanthoma simplexe poromas are confined to the epidermis i.e. uppermost layer of the skin. 2) Dermal duct poromas are confined to the dermis i.e. layer of skin between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissues. 3) Hidradenomas have recently been sub-classified into two groups; 95% are termed clear cell hidradenomas and have features suggesting that they derive from apocrine sweat glands while the remaining 5% are termed poroid hidradenomas and have features suggesting that they derive from eccrine sweat glands. And 4) eccrine poromas are eccrine sweat gland tumors that consist of three cell types (see the  histopathology section of Poromas) and are primarily located in the epidermis and superficial dermis. Poromas may have 2 or more of these variants in the same tumor tissue and the variants typically have histopathology findings that are not clearly distinguishable from each other. PCA tumors may arise from one of these longstanding poromas (in one study this occurred in 18% of cases) but more commonly appear to develop independently of any precursor poroma.PCA are locally invasive tumors that have been treated by surgical resection but often recur at the site of their surgical removal and metastasize to distant tissues before or after their removal. Repeatedly recurrent unresectable and metastatic PCA have been treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. However metastatic PCA has responded poorly to these treatments and carries a poor prognosis.Because of their rarity and lack of distinct clinical features and variable physical and microscopic histological appearances the diagnosis of porocarcinomas is often challenging. PCA has commonly been either mis-diagnosed or over-diagnosed. Under-diagnosis may have been responsible for a recent study conducted in a United Kingdom single center that reported that the number of PCA cases had increased 3-fold over the previous 4 years and was expected to rapidly rise further during the next decade."

        "article": "Shingles also known as herpes zoster is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single wide mark either on the left or right side of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area. Other common symptoms are fever headache and tiredness. The rash usually heals within two to four weeks; however some people develop ongoing nerve pain which can last for months or years a condition called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In those with poor immune function the rash may occur widely. If the rash involves the eye vision loss may occur.Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that also causes chickenpox. In the case of chickenpox also called varicella the initial infection with the virus typically occurs during childhood or adolescence. Once the chickenpox has resolved the virus can remain dormant (inactive) in human nerve cells (dorsal root ganglia or cranial nerves) for years or decades after which it may reactivate. Shingles results when the dormant varicella virus is reactivated. The virus then travels along nerve bodies to nerve endings in the skin producing blisters. During an outbreak of shingles exposure to the varicella virus found in shingles blisters can cause chickenpox in someone who has not yet had chickenpox although that person will not suffer from shingles at least on the first infection. How the virus remains dormant in the body or subsequently re-activates is not well understood.The disease has been recognized since ancient times. Risk factors for reactivation of the dormant virus include old age poor immune function and having contracted chickenpox before 18 months of age. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms presented. Varicella zoster virus is not the same as herpes simplex virus although they belong to the same family of herpesviruses.Shingles vaccines reduce the risk of shingles by 50 to 90% depending on the vaccine used. Vaccination also decreases rates of postherpetic neuralgia and if shingles occurs its severity. If shingles develops antiviral medications such as aciclovir can reduce the severity and duration of disease if started within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash. Evidence does not show a significant effect of antivirals or steroids on rates of postherpetic neuralgia. Paracetamol NSAIDs or opioids may be used to help with acute pain.It is estimated that about a third of people develop shingles at some point in their lives. While shingles is more common among older people children may also get the disease. According to the US National Institutes of Health the number of new cases per year ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 per 1000 person-years among healthy individuals to 3.9 to 11.8 per 1000 person-years among those older than 65 years of age. About half of those living to age 85 will have at least one attack and fewer than 5% will have more than one attack. Although symptoms can be severe risk of death is very low: 0.28 to 0.69 deaths per million."

JEB is the result of a genetic mutation that inhibits protein production that is essential for skin adhesion. Therefore tissues such as skin and mouth epithelia are affected. Blisters form over the entire body causing pain and discomfort and open sores leave newborn foals highly susceptible to secondary infection. The condition can be categorized into two types of mutations: JEB1 and JEB2. JEB1 is found in Belgian Draft horses as well as other related Draft breeds.  In contrast JEB2 is found in American Saddlebred horses."

They are major constituents of the basement membrane namely the basal lamina (the protein network foundation for most cells and organs). Laminins are vital to biological activity influencing cell differentiation migration and adhesion.Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins with a high molecular mass (~400 to ~900 kDa) and possess three different chains (\u03b1 \u03b2 and \u03b3) encoded by five four and three paralogous genes in humans respectively. The laminin molecules are named according to their chain composition e.g. laminin-511 contains \u03b15 \u03b21 and \u03b31 chains. Fourteen other chain combinations have been identified in vivo. The trimeric proteins intersect composing a cruciform structure that is able to bind to other molecules of the extracellular matrix and cell membrane. The three short arms have an affinity for binding to other laminin molecules conducing sheet formation. The long arm is capable of binding to cells and helps anchor organized tissue cells to the basement membrane.Laminins are integral to the structural scaffolding of almost every tissue of an organism\u2014secreted and incorporated into cell-associated extracellular matrices. These glycoproteins are imperative to the maintenance and vitality of tissues; defective laminins can cause muscles to form improperly leading to a form of muscular dystrophy lethal skin blistering disease (junctional epidermolysis bullosa) and/or defects of the kidney filter (nephrotic syndrome)."

        "article": "Heterochromia is a variation in coloration most often used to describe color differences of the iris but can also be applied to color variation of hair or skin. Heterochromia is determined by the production delivery and concentration of melanin (a pigment). It may be inherited or caused by genetic mosaicism chimerism disease or injury. It occurs in humans and certain breeds of domesticated animals.Heterochromia of the eye is called heterochromia iridum or heterochromia iridis. It can be complete sectoral or central. In complete heterochromia one iris is a different color from the other. In sectoral heterochromia part of one iris is a different color from its remainder. In central heterochromia there is a ring around the pupil or possibly spikes of different colors radiating from the pupil.Though multiple causes have been posited the scientific consensus is that a lack of genetic diversity is the primary reason behind heterochromia at least in domestic animals. This is due to a mutation of the genes that determine melanin distribution at the 8-HTP pathway which usually only become corrupted due to chromosomal homogeneity. Though common in some breeds of cats dogs cattle and horses due to inbreeding heterochromia is uncommon in humans affecting fewer than 200000 people in the United States and is not associated with lack of genetic diversity.The affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (hypochromic). In humans an increase of melanin production in the eyes indicates hyperplasia of the iris tissues whereas a lack of melanin indicates hypoplasia.The term is derived from Ancient Greek: \u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 h\u00e9teros \"different\" and \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 chr\u00f4ma \"color\"."

It is a rare skin disorder that primarily affects children under one year of age but can also be found in older children and adults. It was first described in 1905 by Adamson. In 5% to 17% of people the disorder is present at birth but the median age of onset is two years.  JXG is a benign idiopathic cutaneous granulomatous tumor and the most common form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LHC). The lesions appear as orange-red macules or papules and are usually located on the face neck and upper trunk. They may also appear at the groin scrotum penis clitoris toenail palms soles lips lungs bone heart and gastrointestinal tract more rarely. JXG usually manifests with multiple lesions on the head and neck in cases with children under six months of age. The condition usually resolves spontaneously over one to five years. A biopsy of the lesion is critical to confirm the diagnosis.Ocular JXG manifests in up to 10% of people with JXG and may affect their vision. The presence of JXG in the eye can cause spontaneous hyphema secondary glaucoma or even blindness. It is most often seen in the iris but may be found on the eyelid corneoscleral limbus conjunctiva orbit retina choroid optic disc or optic nerve. Of patients with ocular JXG 92% are younger than the age of two. Although cutaneous JXG usually disappear spontaneously ocular lesions rarely improve spontaneously and require treatment. Treatments that have been used include surgical excision intralesional steroid injection cryotherapy and low dose radiotherapy. In the case of a resistant or reoccurring lesion chemotherapy has been used as a treatment. Ocular JXG is usually unilateral and presents with a tumor a red eye with signs of uveitis unilateral glaucoma spontaneous hyphema or heterochromia iridis. Diagnosing and treating the patient as early as possible contributes to the most positive visual outcome.Histiocytic disorders like JXG are identified by the cells that make them up. Immunohistochemical analysis is used to discern the immunoreactivity to certain antibodies in these analyses. JXG is a non-LHC disorder which is a varied group of disorders defined by the accumulation of histiocytes that do not meet criteria to be diagnosed as Langerhans cells. JXG is not metastatic and may be present with lipid deposits. JXG is often accompanied with other disorders such as neurofibromatosis type I and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia. Juvenile variety xanthogranuloma can be distinguished from xanthoma by the spread of the lesion and the lack of lipid abnormalities. Other similar diagnoses include molluscum contagiosum hemangioma and neurofibroma."

This commonly leads to a different approach in diagnosis and treatment of hematological malignancies.Hematological malignancies are malignant neoplasms (\"cancer\") and they are generally treated by specialists in hematology and/or oncology.  In some centers \"hematology/oncology\" is a single subspecialty of internal medicine while in others they are considered separate divisions (there are also surgical and radiation oncologists).  Not all hematological disorders are malignant (\"cancerous\"); these other blood conditions may also be managed by a hematologist.Hematological malignancies may derive from either of the two major blood cell lineages:  myeloid and lymphoid cell lines.  The myeloid cell line normally produces granulocytes erythrocytes thrombocytes macrophages and mast cells; the lymphoid cell line produces B T NK and plasma cells. Lymphomas lymphocytic leukemias and myeloma are from the lymphoid line while acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative diseases are myeloid in origin.A subgroup of them are more severe and are known as haematological malignancies (British English)/hematological malignancies (American English) or blood cancer.

In endemic regions Tzanck test is used to diagnose leishmaniasis and leprosy. For other regions Tzanck test is mainly used to diagnose pemphigus and herpetic infections. Some clinics use biopsies even for herpetic infections.

Over time they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years depending on the HIV subtype.In most cases HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood pre-ejaculate semen and vaginal fluids. Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid and through breast milk. Within these bodily fluids HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.Research has shown (for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples) that HIV is untransmittable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load.HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells) macrophages and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells direct viral killing of infected cells and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level cell-mediated immunity is lost and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections leading to the development of AIDS."

The skin lesions are usually painless purple and may be flat or raised. Lesions can occur singly multiply in a limited area or may be widespread. Depending on the sub-type of disease and level of immune suppression KS may worsen either gradually or quickly. Except for Classical KS where there is generally no immune suppression KS is caused by a combination of immune suppression (such as due to HIV/AIDS) and infection by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8 \u2013 also called KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)).Classic endemic immunosuppression therapy-related (also known as iatrogenic) and epidemic (also known as AIDS-related) sub-types are all described. Classic KS tends to affect older men in regions where KSHV is highly prevalent (Mediterranean Eastern Europe Middle East) is usually slow-growing and most often affects only the legs. Endemic KS is most common in Sub-Saharan Africa and is more aggressive in children while older adults present similarly to classic KS. Immunosuppression therapy-related KS generally occurs in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin. Epidemic KS occurs in people with AIDS and many parts of the body can be affected. KS is diagnosed by tissue biopsy while the extent of disease may be determined by medical imaging.Treatment is based on the sub-type whether the condition is localized or widespread and the person's immune function. Localized skin lesions may be treated by surgery injections of chemotherapy into the lesion or radiation therapy. Widespread disease may be treated with chemotherapy or biologic therapy. In those with HIV/AIDS highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) prevents and often treats KS. In certain cases the addition of chemotherapy may be required. With widespread disease death may occur.The condition is relatively common in people with HIV/AIDS and following organ transplant. Over 35% of people with AIDS may be affected. KS was first described by Moritz Kaposi in 1872. It became more widely known as one of the AIDS-defining illnesses in the 1980s. KSHV was discovered as a causative agent in 1994."

As according to Stokes' law the sedimentation velocity varies like the square of the object's diameter larger aggregates settle faster. While aggregation already takes place at normal physiological fibrinogen levels these tend to increase when an inflammatory process is present leading to increased ESR.The ESR is increased in inflammation pregnancy anemia autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus) infections some kidney diseases and some cancers (such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma). The ESR is decreased in polycythemia hyperviscosity sickle cell anemia leukemia chronic fatigue syndrome low plasma protein (due to liver or kidney disease) and congestive heart failure. Although increases in immunoglobulins usually increase the ESR very high levels can reduce it again due to hyperviscosity of the plasma. This is especially likely with IgM-class paraproteins and to a lesser extent IgA-class. The basal ESR is slightly higher in females."

        "article": "Kawasaki disease (also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a fever and mainly affects children under 5 years of age. It is a form of vasculitis where medium-sized blood vessels become inflamed throughout the body. The fever typically lasts for more than five days and is not affected by usual medications. Other common symptoms include large lymph nodes in the neck a rash in the genital area lips palms or soles of the feet and red eyes. Within three weeks of the onset the skin from the hands and feet may peel after which recovery typically occurs. The disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries which include the formation of coronary artery aneurysms and myocarditis.While the specific cause is unknown it is thought to result from an excessive immune response to particular infections in children who are genetically predisposed to those infections. It is not an infectious disease that is it does not spread between people. Diagnosis is usually based on a person's signs and symptoms. Other tests such as an ultrasound of the heart and blood tests may support the diagnosis. Diagnosis must take into account many other conditions that may present similar features including scarlet fever and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  An emerging 'Kawasaki-like' disease temporally associated with COVID-19 appears to be a distinct syndrome.Typically initial treatment of Kawasaki disease consists of high doses of aspirin and immunoglobulin. Usually with treatment fever resolves within 24 hours and full recovery occurs. If the coronary arteries are involved ongoing treatment or surgery may occasionally be required. Without treatment coronary artery aneurysms occur in up to 25% and about 1% die. With treatment the risk of death is reduced to 0.17%. People who have had coronary artery aneurysms after Kawasaki disease require lifelong cardiological monitoring by specialized teams.Kawasaki disease is rare. It affects between 8 and 67 per 100000 people under the age of five except in Japan where it affects 124 per 100000. Boys are more commonly affected than girls. The disorder is named after Japanese pediatrician Tomisaku Kawasaki who first described it in 1967."

        "article": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS / PIMS-TS) or systemic inflammatory syndrome in COVID-19 (SISCoV) is a rare systemic illness involving persistent fever and extreme inflammation following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 the virus responsible for COVID-19. MIS-C has also been monitored as a potential rare pediatric adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination. Research suggests that COVID-19 vaccination lowers the risk of MIS-C and in cases where symptoms develop after vaccine is likely extremely rare or related to factors like recent exposure to COVID-19. It can rapidly lead to medical emergencies such as insufficient blood flow around the body (a condition known as shock). Failure of one or more organs can occur. A warning sign is unexplained persistent fever with severe symptoms following exposure to COVID-19. Prompt referral to paediatric specialists is essential and families need to seek urgent medical assistance. Most affected children will need intensive care. All affected children have persistent fever. Other clinical features vary. The first symptoms often include acute abdominal pain with diarrhoea or vomiting. Muscle pain and general tiredness are frequent and low blood pressure is also common. Symptoms can also include pink eye rashes enlarged lymph nodes swollen hands and feet and \"strawberry tongue\".  Various mental disturbances are possible. A cytokine storm may take place in which the child's innate immune system stages an excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory response. Heart failure is common. Clinical complications can include damage to the heart muscle respiratory distress acute kidney injury and increased blood coagulation. Coronary artery abnormalities can develop (ranging from dilatation to aneurysms).This life-threatening disease has proved fatal in under 2% of reported cases. Early recognition and prompt specialist attention are essential. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been used with good responses being recorded for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with or without corticosteroids. Oxygen is often needed. Supportive care is key for treating clinical complications. Most children who receive expert hospital care survive.Knowledge of this newly described syndrome is evolving rapidly. Its clinical features may appear somewhat similar to Kawasaki disease a rare disease of unknown origin that typically affects young children in which blood vessels become inflamed throughout the body. It can also show features of other serious inflammatory conditions of childhood including toxic shock and macrophage activation syndromes. Nevertheless it appears to be a separate syndrome. Older children tend to be affected.This emerging condition has been defined slightly differently (using different names) by the World Health Organization (WHO) the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although the condition is thought to follow SARS-CoV-2 viral infection antigen or antibody tests are not always positive. Exclusion of alternative causes including bacterial and other infections is essential for differential diagnosis. Some general clinical guidance has been provided by the RCPCH the National Institutes of Health the American College of Rheumatology and the American Academy of Pediatrics.Clusters of new cases have been reported two to six weeks after local peaks in viral transmission. The disease is thought to be driven by a delayed biological mechanism in certain predisposed children.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has rated risk to children in Europe as being 'low' overall based on a 'very low' likelihood of a child developing this 'high impact' disease. Regarding ethnicity the condition seems to affect more children of African Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic descent whereas Kawasaki disease affects more of East Asian ancestry. Initial reports regarded children in various parts of Europe and the United States and it was unclear to what extent the condition had gone unrecognized elsewhere. Reports have since emerged of cases in various other countries around the world.  In adults a similar condition has occasionally been reported which has been called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A)."

Cortisol is converted by the action of the enzyme corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 into the inactive metabolite cortisone particularly in the kidneys. This is done by oxidizing the alcohol group at carbon 11 (in the six-membered ring fused to the five-membered ring). Cortisone is converted back to the active steroid cortisol by stereospecific hydrogenation at carbon 11 by the enzyme 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 particularly in the liver.The term \"cortisone\" is frequently misused to mean either any corticosteroid or hydrocortisone which is in fact cortisol. Many who speak of receiving a \"cortisone shot\" or taking \"cortisone\" are more likely receiving hydrocortisone or one of many other much more potent synthetic corticosteroids.Cortisone can be administered as a prodrug meaning it has to be converted by the body (specifically the liver converting it into cortisol) after administration to be effective. It is used to treat a variety of ailments and can be administered intravenously orally intra-articularly (into a joint) or transcutaneously. Cortisone suppresses various elements of the immune system thus reducing inflammation and attendant pain and swelling.  Risks exist in particular in the long-term use of cortisone. However using cortisone only results in very mild activity and very often more potent steroids are used instead."

It grows rapidly reaching a large size within days or weeks and if untreated for months will almost always starve itself of nourishment necrose (die) slough and heal with scarring. Keratoacanthoma is commonly found on sun-exposed skin often face forearms and hands. It is rarely found at a mucocutaneous junction or on mucous membranes.Keratoacanthoma may be difficult to distinguish visually from a skin cancer. Under the microscope keratoacanthoma very closely resembles squamous cell carcinoma. In order to differentiate between the two almost the entire structure needs to be removed and examined. While some pathologists classify keratoacanthoma as a distinct entity and not a malignancy about 6% of clinical and histological keratoacanthomas do progress to invasive and aggressive squamous cell cancers; some pathologists may label KA as \"well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma keratoacanthoma variant\" and prompt definitive surgery may be recommended."

        "article": "The following is a list of cancer types. Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in.  However some body parts contain multiple types of tissue so for greater precision cancers are additionally classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells originated from. These types include:Carcinoma: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers that occur in older adults. Nearly all cancers developing in the breast prostate lung pancreas and colon are carcinomas.Sarcoma: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone cartilage fat nerve) each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside of the bone marrow.Lymphoma and leukemia: These two classes of cancer arise from immature cells that originate in the bone marrow and are intended to fully differentiate and mature into normal components of the immune system and the blood respectively. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children accounting for ~30% of cases.  However far more adults than children develop lymphoma and leukemia.Germ cell tumor: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma respectively).Blastoma: Cancers derived from immature \"precursor\" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are generally more common in children (e.g. neuroblastoma retinoblastoma nephroblastoma hepatoblastoma medulloblastoma etc.) than in older adults.Cancers are usually named using -carcinoma -sarcoma or -blastoma as a suffix with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example the most common cancer of the liver parenchyma (\"hepato-\" = liver) arising from malignant epithelial cells (\"carcinoma\") would be called a hepatocarcinoma while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma. Similarly a cancer arising from malignant fat cells would be termed a liposarcoma. For some common cancers the English organ name is used. For example the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast. Benign tumors (which are not cancers) are usually named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is fibroid). Confusingly some types of cancer use the -noma suffix examples including melanoma and seminoma.Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope such as giant cell carcinoma spindle cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma."

        "article": "Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as \"essentially an oral mucosal white lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion.\" Oral leukoplakia is a white patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches. There are generally no other symptoms. It usually occurs within the mouth although sometimes mucosa in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract urinary tract or genitals may be affected.The cause of leukoplakia is unknown. Risk factors for formation inside the mouth include smoking chewing tobacco excessive alcohol and use of betel nuts. One specific type is common in HIV/AIDS. It is a precancerous lesion a tissue alteration in which cancer is more likely to develop. The chance of cancer formation depends on the type with between 3\u201315% of localized leukoplakia and 70\u2013100% of proliferative leukoplakia developing into squamous cell carcinoma.Leukoplakia is a descriptive term that should only be applied after other possible causes are ruled out. Tissue biopsy generally shows increased keratin build up with or without abnormal cells but is not diagnostic. Other conditions that can appear similar include yeast infections lichen planus and keratosis due to repeated minor trauma. The lesions from a yeast infection can typically be rubbed off while those of leukoplakia cannot.Treatment recommendations depend on features of the lesion. If abnormal cells are present or the lesion is small surgical removal is often recommended; otherwise close follow up at three to six month intervals may be sufficient. People are generally advised to stop smoking and limit the drinking of alcohol. In potentially half of cases leukoplakia will shrink with stopping smoking; however if smoking is continued up to 66% of cases will become more white and thick. The percentage of people affected is estimated at 1\u20133%. Leukoplakia becomes more common with age typically not occurring until after 30. Rates may be as high as 8% in men over the age of 70."

Desogestrel is a progestin or a synthetic progestogen and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has very weak androgenic and glucocorticoid activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of etonogestrel (3-ketodesogestrel) in the body.Desogestrel was discovered in 1972 and was introduced for medical use in Europe in 1981. It became available in the United States in 1992. Desogestrel is sometimes referred to as a \"third-generation\" progestin. Along with norethisterone it is one of the only progestins that is widely available as a progestogen-only \"mini pill\" for birth control. Desogestrel is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020 the version with ethinylestradiol was the 120th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 5\u00a0million prescriptions."

While thalidomide has been used in a number of HIV-associated conditions such use is associated with increased levels of the virus.Common side effects include sleepiness rash and dizziness. Severe side effects include tumor lysis syndrome blood clots and peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen and carries an extremely high risk of severe life-threatening birth defects if administered during pregnancy. It causes skeletal deformities such as amelia (absence of legs and/or arms) absence of bones and phocomelia (malformation of the limbs). A single dose of thalidomide regardless of dosage is enough to cause teratogenic effects.Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany where it was available over the counter. When first released thalidomide was promoted for anxiety trouble sleeping \"tension\" and morning sickness. While it was initially thought to be safe in pregnancy concerns regarding birth defects arose resulting in its removal from the market in Europe in 1961. The total number of infants affected by thalidomide use during pregnancy is estimated at 10000 of whom about 40% died around the time of birth. Those who survived had limb eye urinary tract and heart problems. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey a reviewer at the FDA. The birth defects caused by thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries.It was approved in the United States in 1998 for use as a treatment for cancer.

It produces events worldwide that showcase 11 weight divisions (eight men's and three women's) and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. As of 2022 it had held over 600 events. Dana White has been its president since 2001 and CEO since 2023. Under White's stewardship it has grown into a global multi-billion-dollar enterprise.The UFC was founded by businessman Art Davie and Brazilian martial artist Rorion Gracie and the first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver Colorado. The purpose of the UFC's early competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines. In subsequent events more rigorous rules were created and fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.The UFC was initially owned by the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG) until it had financial issues and it was sold to the brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta in 2001 who formed the company Zuffa to operate the UFC and placed Dana White as the president of the company. In 2016 UFC's parent company Zuffa was sold to a group led by Endeavor then known as William Morris Endeavor (WME\u2013IMG) including Silver Lake Partners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital for US$4.025 billion. In 2021 Endeavor bought out Zuffa's other owners at a valuation of $1.7 billion. The organization had 578 fighters contracted as of January 2023.With a TV deal and expansion in Australia Asia Europe and new markets within the United States the UFC has achieved greater mainstream media coverage. It earned US$609 million in 2015 and its next domestic media rights agreement with ESPN was valued at $1.5 billion over a five-year term.In April 2023 Endeavor Group Holdings announced that UFC would merge with the wrestling promotion WWE to form TKO Group Holdings a new public company majority-owned by Endeavor with Vince McMahon serving as an executive chairman of the new entity and White remaining as UFC president. The merger was completed on September 12 2023."

The term refers to a group of six chemically similar compounds i.e. \"vitamers\" which can be interconverted in biological systems. Its active form pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate serves as a coenzyme in more than 140 enzyme reactions in amino acid glucose and lipid metabolism.Plants synthesize pyridoxine as a means of protection from the UV-B radiation found in sunlight and for the role it plays in the synthesis of chlorophyll. Animals cannot synthesize any of the various forms of the vitamin and hence must obtain it via diet either of plants or of other animals. There is some absorption of the vitamin produced by intestinal bacteria but this is not sufficient to meet dietary needs. For adult humans recommendations from various countries' food regulatory agencies are in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 milligrams (mg) per day. These same agencies also recognize ill effects from intakes that are too high and so set safe upper limits ranging from as low as 25\u00a0mg/day to as high as 100\u00a0mg/day depending on the country. Beef pork fowl and fish are generally good sources; dairy eggs mollusks and crustaceans also contain vitamin B6 but at lower levels. There is enough in a wide variety of plant foods so that a vegetarian or vegan diet does not put consumers at risk for deficiency.Dietary deficiency is rare. Classic clinical symptoms include rash and inflammation around the mouth and eyes plus neurological effects that include drowsiness and peripheral neuropathy affecting sensory and motor nerves in the hands and feet. In addition to dietary shortfall deficiency can be the result of anti-vitamin drugs. There are also rare genetic defects that can trigger vitamin B6 deficiency-dependent epileptic seizures in infants. These are responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate therapy."

        "article": "Pulsed operation of lasers refers to any laser not classified as continuous wave so that the optical power appears in pulses of some duration at some repetition rate. This encompasses a wide range of technologies addressing a number of different motivations. Some lasers are pulsed simply because they cannot be run in continuous mode.In other cases the application requires the production of pulses having as large an energy as possible. Since the pulse energy is equal to the average power divided by the repetition rate this goal can sometimes be satisfied by lowering the rate of pulses so that more energy can be built up in between pulses. In laser ablation for example a small volume of material at the surface of a work piece can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time whereas supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed into the bulk of the piece never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at a particular point.Other applications rely on the peak pulse power (rather than the energy in the pulse) especially in order to obtain nonlinear optical effects. For a given pulse energy this requires creating pulses of the shortest possible duration utilizing techniques such as Q-switching.The optical bandwidth of a pulse cannot be narrower than the reciprocal of the pulse width. In the case of extremely short pulses that implies lasing over a considerable bandwidth quite contrary to the very narrow bandwidths typical of continuous wave (CW) lasers. The lasing medium in some dye lasers and vibronic solid-state lasers produces optical gain over a wide bandwidth making a laser possible which can thus generate pulses of light as short as a few femtoseconds."

Tattoo artists create these designs using several tattooing processes and techniques including hand-tapped traditional tattoos and modern tattoo machines. The history of tattooing goes back to Neolithic times practiced across the globe by many cultures and the symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures.Tattoos may be decorative (with no specific meaning) symbolic (with a specific meaning to the wearer) pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item) or textual (words or pictographs from written languages). Many tattoos serve as rites of passage marks of status and rank symbols of religious and spiritual devotion decorations for bravery marks of fertility pledges of love amulets and talismans protection and as punishment like the marks of outcasts slaves and convicts. Extensive decorative tattooing has also been part of the work of performance artists such as tattooed ladies.Although tattoo art has existed at least since the first known tattooed person \u00d6tzi lived around the year 3330 BC the way society perceives tattoos has varied immensely throughout history. In the 20th century tattoo art throughout most of the world was associated with a limited selection of specific \"rugged\" lifestyles notably sailors and prisoners. Today people choose to be tattooed for artistic cosmetic sentimental/memorial religious and spiritual reasons or to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly a parent or child) or about an unrelated person.Tattoos can also be used for functional purposes such as identification permanent makeup and medical purposes."

Commercial manufacturers combine pigments with carriers such as ethyl alcohol or distilled water to create liquid inks. They may include preservatives to reduce risk of contamination and other additives to adjust the viscosity of the ink.Pigments and preservatives in tattoo ink can cause allergic reactions in skin. A portion of pigment applied in a tattoo may migrate to other places in the body such as lymph nodes. Some common tattoo pigments are chemicals that may cause cancer but longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether these chemicals increase risk of cancer if embedded in the skin.The European Union has started to prohibit use of certain pigments in tattoo inks due to safety concerns. In the United States tattoo inks are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which generally does not investigate commercial inks unless it receives complaints about specific safety issues such as contamination. The FDA has not specifically approved any pigments for cosmetic tattoos.Tattooing is an ancient practice and archeologists have found evidence of tattoos made with soot among people in multiple continents thousands of years ago. Especially after the invention of the electric tattoo machine in the late 1800s tattoo artists experimented with many chemicals to identify durable pigments that could produce a range of colors without causing bad reactions often testing inks in their own skin.Most tattoo inks are intended to be permanent but there are commercial methods for creating semi-permanent tattoos. There are also traditions of temporary tattoos applied to the surface of the skin using pigments such as mehndi."

The process of tattooing generally creates permanent markings in the skin but people have attempted many methods to try to hide or destroy tattoos.The standard modern method is the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigment using Q-switched lasers. Different types of Q-switched lasers are used to target different colors of tattoo ink; depending on the specific light absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments. Typically black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely using Q-switched lasers while lighter colors such as yellows and greens are very difficult to remove. Success depends on a wide variety of factors including skin color ink color and the depth at which the ink was applied.Recent research has investigated the potential of multi-pass treatments and the use of picosecond laser technology."

Signs and symptoms may include high blood pressure abdominal obesity but with thin arms and legs reddish stretch marks a round red face due to facial plethora a fat lump between the shoulders weak muscles weak bones acne and fragile skin that heals poorly. Women may have more hair and irregular menstruation. Occasionally there may be changes in mood headaches and a chronic feeling of tiredness.Cushing's syndrome is caused by either excessive cortisol-like medication such as prednisone or a tumor that either produces or results in the production of excessive cortisol by the adrenal glands. Cases due to a pituitary adenoma are known as Cushing's disease which is the second most common cause of Cushing's syndrome after medication. A number of other tumors often referred to as ectopic due to their placement outside the pituitary may also cause Cushing's. Some of these are associated with inherited disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex. Diagnosis requires a number of steps. The first step is to check the medications a person takes. The second step is to measure levels of cortisol in the urine saliva or in the blood after taking dexamethasone. If this test is abnormal the cortisol may be measured late at night. If the cortisol remains high a blood test for ACTH may be done.Most cases can be treated and cured. If due to medications these can often be slowly decreased if still required or slowly stopped. If caused by a tumor it may be treated by a combination of surgery chemotherapy and/or radiation. If the pituitary was affected other medications may be required to replace its lost function. With treatment life expectancy is usually normal. Some in whom surgery is unable to remove the entire tumor have an increased risk of death.About two to three cases per million persons are caused overtly by a tumor. It most commonly affects people who are 20 to 50 years of age. Women are affected three times more often than men. A mild degree of overproduction of cortisol without obvious symptoms however is more common. Cushing's syndrome was first described by American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1932. Cushing's syndrome may also occur in other animals including cats dogs and horses."

For pain or fever effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.One common adverse effect is an upset stomach. More significant side effects include stomach ulcers stomach bleeding and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older drink alcohol take other NSAIDs or are on other blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.A precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree (genus Salix) has been used for its health effects for at least 2400 years. In 1853 chemist Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time.

For example chronic wounds often remain in the inflammatory stage for too long. To overcome that stage and jump-start the healing process a number of factors need to be addressed such as bacterial burden necrotic tissue and moisture balance of the whole wound.  In acute wounds there is a precise balance between production and degradation of molecules such as collagen; in chronic wounds this balance is lost and degradation plays too large a role.Chronic wounds may never heal or may take years to do so.  These wounds can cause patients severe emotional and physical stress and create a significant financial burden on patients and the whole healthcare system.Acute and chronic wounds are at opposite ends of a spectrum of wound-healing types that progress toward being healed at different rates."

Chronic wound pain is present for six months or more and occurs without any manipulation of the wound. Chronic wound pain is persistent and exists at rest.Persistent pain is used interchangeably or to replace the term chronic pain.    Intermittent or continuous pain that is present for three months or more is considered as persistent pain. Persistent pain is also referred to as neuropathic pain.Depending on the sensation associated with neuropathic pain it may be considered as acute or chronic. Acute neuropathic pain is associated with burning squeezing throbbing shooting or electric shock sensations that resolve. Neuropathic sensations such as numbness tingling and prickling are considered as chronic neuropathic pain.

        "article": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) also simply called sickle cell is a group of hemoglobin-related blood disorders typically inherited. The most common type is known as sickle cell anemia. It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin found in red blood cells. This leads to a rigid sickle-like shape under certain circumstances. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop such as attacks of pain (known as a sickle cell crisis) in joints anemia swelling in the hands and feet bacterial infections dizziness and stroke. Long-term pain may develop as people get older. The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years. It often gets worse within age. All the major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver heart kidneys gallbladder eyes bones and joints also can suffer damage from the abnormal functions of the sickle cells and their inability to flow through the small blood vessels correctly.Sickle cell disease occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB) that makes haemoglobin one from each parent. This gene occurs in chromosome 11. Several subtypes exist depending on the exact mutation in each haemoglobin gene. An attack can be set off by temperature changes stress dehydration and high altitude. A person with a single abnormal copy does not usually have symptoms and is said to have sickle cell trait. Such people are also referred to as carriers. Diagnosis is by a blood test and some countries test all babies at birth for the disease. Diagnosis is also possible during pregnancy.The care of people with sickle cell disease may include infection prevention with vaccination and antibiotics high fluid intake folic acid supplementation and pain medication. Other measures may include blood transfusion and the medication hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). In 2023 new gene therapies were approved. A small percentage of people can be cured by a transplant of bone marrow cells.As of 2015 about 4.4 million people have sickle cell disease while an additional 43 million have sickle cell trait. Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions of people worldwide with a higher prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere (South America the Caribbean and Central America) Saudi Arabia India and Mediterranean countries like Turkey Greece and Italy. In 2015 it resulted in about 114800 deaths. The condition was first described in the medical literature by American physician James B. Herrick in 1910. In 1949 its genetic transmission was determined by E. A. Beet and J. V. Neel. In 1954 the protective effect against malaria of sickle cell trait was described."

Compression stockings are elastic compression garments worn around the leg compressing the limb. This reduces the diameter of distended veins and increases venous blood flow velocity and valve effectiveness. Compression therapy helps decrease venous pressure prevents venous stasis and impairments of venous walls and relieves heavy and aching legs.Knee-high compression stockings are used not only to help increase circulation but also to help prevent the formation of blood clots in the lower legs. They also aid in the treatment of ulcers of the lower legs.Unlike traditional dress or athletic stockings and socks compression stockings use stronger elastics to create significant pressure on the legs ankles and feet. Compression stockings are tightest at the ankles and gradually become less constrictive toward the knees and thighs. By compressing the surface veins arteries and muscles they force circulating blood through narrower channels. As a result the arterial pressure is increased which causes more blood to return to the heart and less blood to pool in the feet.There are two types of compression stockings gradient and anti-embolism."

A minority of DVTs occur in the arms. Symptoms can include pain swelling redness and enlarged veins in the affected area but some DVTs have no symptoms. The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot to embolize (detach from the veins) travel as an embolus through the right side of the heart and become lodged in a pulmonary artery that supplies blood to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT and PE comprise the cardiovascular disease of venous thromboembolism (VTE). About two-thirds of VTE manifests as DVT only with one-third manifesting as PE with or without DVT. The most frequent long-term DVT complication is post-thrombotic syndrome which can cause pain swelling a sensation of heaviness itching and in severe cases ulcers. Recurrent VTE occurs in about 30% of those in the ten years following an initial VTE.The mechanism behind DVT formation typically involves some combination of decreased blood flow increased tendency to clot changes to the blood vessel wall and inflammation. Risk factors include recent surgery older age active cancer obesity infection inflammatory diseases antiphospholipid syndrome personal history and family history of VTE trauma injuries lack of movement hormonal birth control pregnancy and the period following birth. VTE has a strong genetic component accounting for approximately 50 to 60% of the variability in VTE rates. Genetic factors include non-O blood type deficiencies of antithrombin protein C and protein S and the mutations of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A. In total dozens of genetic risk factors have been identified.People suspected of having DVT can be assessed using a prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test can also be used to assist with excluding the diagnosis or to signal a need for further testing. Diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by ultrasound of the suspected veins. VTE becomes much more common with age. The condition is rare in children but occurs in almost 1% of those \u2265 age 85 annually. Asian Asian-American Native American and Hispanic individuals have a lower VTE risk than Whites or Blacks. Populations in Asia have VTE rates at 15 to 20% of what is seen in Western countries.Using blood thinners is the standard treatment. Typical medications include rivaroxaban apixaban and warfarin. Beginning warfarin treatment requires an additional non-oral anticoagulant often injections of heparin. Prevention of VTE for the general population includes avoiding obesity and maintaining an active lifestyle. Preventive efforts following low-risk surgery include early and frequent walking. Riskier surgeries generally prevent VTE with a blood thinner or aspirin combined with intermittent pneumatic compression."

Complications can include bleeding or superficial thrombophlebitis. Varices in the scrotum are known as a varicocele while those around the anus are known as hemorrhoids. Due to the various physical social and psychological effects of varicose veins they can negatively affect one's quality of life.Varicose veins have no specific cause. Risk factors include obesity lack of exercise leg trauma and family history of the condition. They also develop more commonly during pregnancy. Occasionally they result from chronic venous insufficiency. Underlying causes include weak or damaged valves in the veins. They are typically diagnosed by examination including observation by ultrasound.By contrast spider veins affect the capillaries and are smaller.Treatment may involve lifestyle changes or medical procedures with the goal of improving symptoms and appearance. Lifestyle changes may include wearing compression stockings exercising elevating the legs and weight loss. Possible medical procedures include sclerotherapy laser surgery and vein stripping. Reoccurrence is common following treatment.Varicose veins are very common affecting about 30% of people at some time in their lives. They become more common with age. Women develop varicose veins about twice as often as men. Varicose veins have been described throughout history and have been treated with surgery since at least A.D. 400."

It is a harmless (benign) hyperplasia of melanocytes which is linear in its spread. This means the hyperplasia of melanocytes is restricted to the cell layer directly above the basement membrane of the epidermis where melanocytes normally reside. This is in contrast to the \"nests\" of multi-layer melanocytes found in moles (melanocytic nevi). Because of this characteristic feature the adjective \"lentiginous\" is used to describe other skin lesions that similarly proliferate linearly within the basal cell layer."

They range in color from light brown to red or black and are located in areas most often exposed to the sun particularly the hands face shoulders arms and forehead and the scalp if bald.The spots derive their name from the fact that they were once incorrectly believed to be caused by liver problems but they are physiologically unrelated to the liver save for a similar color. From the age of 40 the skin is less able to regenerate from sun exposure and liver spots are very common in this age group particularly in those who spend time in the sun.In the overwhelming majority of cases liver spots pose no threat and require no treatment though they occasionally have been known to obscure the detection of skin cancer. However despite being a benign condition liver spots are sometimes considered unsightly and some people choose to have them removed.

They form part of the superorder Xenarthra along with the anteaters and sloths. 21 extant species of armadillo have been described some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armor. All species are native to the Americas where they inhabit a variety of different environments. Living armadillos are characterized by a leathery armor shell and long sharp claws for digging. They have short legs but can move quite quickly. The average length of an armadillo is about 75\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) including its tail. The giant armadillo grows up to 150\u00a0cm (59\u00a0in) and weighs up to 54\u00a0kg (119\u00a0lb) while the pink fairy armadillo has a length of only 13\u201315\u00a0cm (5\u20136\u00a0in). When threatened by a predator Tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball; they are the only species of armadillo capable of this.Recent genetic research has shown that the megafaunal glyptodonts (up to 1.5 metres (4.9\u00a0ft) tall with maximum body masses of around 2 tonnes) which became extinct around 12000 years ago are true armadillos more closely related to all other living armadillos than to Dasypus (the long-nosed or naked-tailed armadillos). Armadillos are currently classified into two families Dasypodidae with Dasypus as the only living genus and Chlamyphoridae which contains all other living armadillos as well as the glyptodonts."

        "article": "Lepromatous leprosy is a form of leprosy characterized by pale macules in the skin.:\u200a346\u200aIt results from the failure of Th1 cell activation which is necessary to eradicate the mycobacteria (Th1 response is required to activate macrophages that engulf and contain the disease). In lepromatous leprosy TH2 response is turned on and because of reciprocal inhibition (IL-4; IL-10) the cell-mediated response (TH1) is depressed. Lepromatous leprosy  in contrast to the tuberculoid form of leprosy  is characterized by the absence of epithelioid cells in the lesions. In this form of leprosy Mycobacterium leprae are found in lesion in  large numbers. This is the most unfavorable clinical variant of leprosy.This debilitating form of leprosy begins to spread causing the eyebrows to disappear and spongy tumor like swellings appear on the face and body. The disease attacks the internal organs bones joints and marrow of the body resulting in physical degeneration. The result is deformity with loss of feeling in the fingers and toes which eventually fall off. Contrary to popular belief both forms of leprosy are curable with the lepromatous form classically treated with antibiotics dapsone rifampin and clofazimine for as long as 2\u20135 years but if left untreated the person may die up to 20 or 30 years from its inception.Early detection of the disease is of utmost importance since severe physical and neurological damage are irreversible even if cured (e.g. blindness loss of digits/limbs/sensation). Early infection is characterized by a well demarcated usually pale skin lesion which has lost its hair and there may be many of these lesions if the infection is more severe (most commonly found on the cooler parts of the body such as the elbows knees fingers or scrotum as the bacteria thrive in cooler environments). This early presentation is the same for both tuberculous and lepromatous forms of leprosy as they are a spectrum of the same disease (lepromatous being the more contagious and severe form in patients with impaired Th1 response). Disease progression is extremely slow and signs of infection may not appear for years.Family members of those with the disease and especially children are most at risk. The disease is believed to be spread through respiratory droplets in close quarters like its relative Mycobacterium tuberculosis and similarly requires extended exposure to an individual in most situations so outsiders and healthcare workers are normally not infected (except with the most infective individuals such as those in the most progressed lepromatous forms as those patients have the highest bacterial loads)."

        "article": "Aphids are small sap-sucking insects and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Common names include greenfly and blackfly although individuals within a species can vary widely in color. The group includes the fluffy white woolly aphids. A typical life cycle involves flightless females giving live birth to female nymphs\u2014who may also be already pregnant an adaptation scientists call telescoping generations\u2014without the involvement of males. Maturing rapidly females breed profusely so that the number of these insects multiplies quickly. Winged females may develop later in the season allowing the insects to colonize new plants. In temperate regions a phase of sexual reproduction occurs in the autumn with the insects often overwintering as eggs.The life cycle of some species involves an alternation between two species of host plants for example between an annual crop and a woody plant. Some species feed on only one type of plant while others are generalists colonizing many plant groups. About 5000 species of aphid have been described all included in the family Aphididae. Around 400 of these are found on food and fiber crops and many are serious pests of agriculture and forestry as well as an annoyance for gardeners. So-called dairying ants have a mutualistic relationship with aphids tending them for their honeydew and protecting them from predators.Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. In addition to weakening the plant by sucking sap they act as vectors for plant viruses and disfigure ornamental plants with deposits of honeydew and the subsequent growth of sooty moulds. Because of their ability to rapidly increase in numbers by asexual reproduction and telescopic development they are a highly successful group of organisms from an ecological standpoint.Control of aphids is not easy. Insecticides do not always produce reliable results given resistance to several classes of insecticide and the fact that aphids often feed on the undersides of leaves. On a garden scale water jets and soap sprays are quite effective. Natural enemies include predatory ladybugs hoverfly larvae parasitic wasps aphid midge larvae crab spiders lacewing larvae and entomopathogenic fungi. An integrated pest management strategy using biological pest control can work but is difficult to achieve except in enclosed environments such as greenhouses."

Head lice are wingless insects that spend their entire lives on the human scalp and feed exclusively on human blood. Humans are the only known hosts of this specific parasite while chimpanzees and bonobos host a closely related species Pediculus schaeffi. Other species of lice infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds.Lice differ from other hematophagic ectoparasites such as fleas in spending their entire lifecycle on a host. Head lice cannot fly and their short stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces.The non-disease-carrying head louse differs from the related disease-carrying body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two subspecies are morphologically almost identical but do not normally interbreed. From genetic studies they are thought to have diverged as subspecies about 30000\u2013110000 years ago when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing. A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse the pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis) also infests humans. It is morphologically different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. Louse infestation of the body is known as pediculosis pediculosis capitis for head lice pediculosis corporis for body lice and phthiriasis for pubic lice."

Phthiraptera has variously been recognized as an order infraorder or a parvorder as a result of developments in phylogenetic research.Lice are obligate parasites living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal except for monotremes pangolins and bats. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris whereas sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host cementing their eggs called nits to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs which moult three times before becoming fully grown a process that takes about four weeks.Genetic evidence indicates that lice are a highly modified lineage of Psocoptera (now called Psocodea) commonly known as booklice barklice or barkflies. The oldest known fossil lice are from the Cretaceous.Humans host two species of louse\u2014the head louse and the body louse are subspecies of Pediculus humanus; and the pubic louse Pthirus pubis. The body louse has the smallest genome of any known insect; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research.Lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse was one of the early subjects of microscopy appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book Micrographia."

There may be some grey-blue discolouration at the feeding site and eggs and lice may be visible. Scratch marks crusting and scarring may be seen and there may be signs of secondary bacterial infection.Diagnosis is by visualising the nits or live lice either directly or with a magnifying glass. Investigations for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are usually performed.First line treatment usually contains permethrin and is available over the counter. Two rounds of treatment at least a week apart are usually required to kill newly hatched nymphs. Washing bedding and clothing in hot water kills the lice and transmission can be prevented by avoiding sexual contact until no signs of infestation exist. Eggs may be removed by combing pubic hair with a comb dipped in vinegar. Sexual partners should be evaluated and treated.Infestation with pubic lice is found in all parts of the world and occurs in all ethnic groups and all levels of society.

Studies are under way to gain a better understanding of the parasite and the host-parasite interactions. Recent evidence is also emerging that L. salmonis in the Atlantic has sufficient genetic differences from L. salmonis from the Pacific to suggest that Atlantic and Pacific L. salmonis may have independently co-evolved with Atlantic and Pacific salmonids respectively."

The disease can be either localized to the skin or involve other organs as well. Symptoms may include areas of thickened skin stiffness feeling tired and poor blood flow to the fingers or toes with cold exposure. One form of the condition known as CREST syndrome classically results in calcium deposits Raynaud's syndrome esophageal problems thickening of the skin of the fingers and toes and areas of small dilated blood vessels.The cause is unknown but it may be due to an abnormal immune response. Risk factors include family history certain genetic factors and exposure to silica. The underlying mechanism involves the abnormal growth of connective tissue which is believed to be the result of the immune system attacking healthy tissues. Diagnosis is based on symptoms supported by a skin biopsy or blood tests.While no cure is known treatment may improve symptoms. Medications used include corticosteroids methotrexate and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Outcome depends on the extent of disease. Those with localized disease generally have a normal life expectancy. In those with systemic disease life expectancy can be affected and this varies based on subtype. Death is often due to lung gastrointestinal or heart complications.About three per 100000 people per year develop the systemic form. The condition most often begins in middle age. Women are more often affected than men. Scleroderma symptoms were first described in 1753 by Carlo Curzio and then well documented in 1842. The term is from the Greek skleros meaning \"hard\" and derma meaning \"skin\"."

The IgA dimeric form is the most prevalent and when it has bound the Secretory component is also called secretory IgA (sIgA).  sIgA is the main immunoglobulin found in mucous secretions including tears saliva sweat colostrum and secretions from the genitourinary tract gastrointestinal tract prostate and respiratory epithelium. It is also found in small amounts in blood. The secretory component of sIgA protects the immunoglobulin from being degraded by proteolytic enzymes; thus sIgA can survive in the harsh gastrointestinal tract environment and provide protection against microbes that multiply in body secretions. sIgA can also inhibit inflammatory effects of other immunoglobulins. IgA is a poor activator of the complement system and opsonizes only weakly. "

Fat accumulates in the facial area (\"moon face\") dorsocervical region (\"buffalo hump\") and abdominal area (\"pot belly\" or \"beer belly\") whereas the thickness of subcutaneous fat in the limbs is decreased. The resulting appearance has been described as \"Cushingoid\" in relation to the fact that it also occurs in individuals with Cushing's syndrome (abnormally high cortisol levels). The condition is considered by patients to be the most distressing side effect caused by corticosteroids.Short-term therapy (&lt;3 months) with 10 to 30\u00a0mg/day of a prednisone equivalent has been reported to be associated with Cushingoid traits in 15 to 40%. Long-term therapy (&gt;3 months) with corticosteroids has been associated with Cushingoid features in 32 to 83% of individuals. However these symptoms have mostly been diagnosed in a subjective and observer-dependent manner. In a prospective study the cumulative incidence of CIL with high-dose prednisone therapy was found to be 61% after 3\u00a0months 65% after 6\u00a0months 68% after 9\u00a0months and 69% after 12\u00a0months. One study found that even a very low dosage of prednisone of 5\u00a0mg/day was associated with symptoms of \"Cushing's syndrome\". It has been said that data on risk factors for CIL such as corticosteroid dosage or duration of therapy is surprisingly sparse. Possible risk factors for CIL include high residual cortisol secretion decreased clearance of corticosteroids female sex younger age (&lt;50 years) high initial body-mass index and high caloric intake.CIL has been found to be usually reversible at prednisone-equivalent dosages of less than 10\u00a0mg/day. A low-calorie diet may be considered to limit the risk of CIL or to attempt to reverse it. CIL is not merely an aesthetic adverse effect as it has been associated with features of metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance dyslipidemia and high blood pressure."

It is a genetic condition that is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene which encodes profibrillin and affects the cleavage products of profibrillin fibrillin-1 a fibrous structural protein and asprosin a glucogenic protein hormone. As of 2016 fewer than 10\u00a0cases of the condition have been reported. Lizzie Vel\u00e1squez and Abby Solomon have become known publicly through the media for having the condition.In addition to severe lipodystrophy (loss of adipose tissue) individuals with MPL show a concomitant marked loss of lean tissue mass which also contributes to their \"skinny\" appearance. Based on visual inspection it was originally thought that the lipodystrophy associated with MPL was generalized. However it appears in fact to be partial being confined to the face distal extremities and the paravertebral and lateral regions of the buttocks. Normal amounts of subcutaneous fat are found in the torso over the chest and abdomen. As such the breasts are normal in females with MPL.Individuals with MPL have an appearance of being prematurely aged but this is not due to actual early aging and is instead due to their paucity of subcutaneous fat. As such MPL is not truly a form of progeria.In 2016 it was discovered that the partial lipodystrophy associated with MPL is caused by loss of the C-terminal domain cleavage product of profibrillin and novel glucogenic protein hormone which has been named asprosin. Due to asprosin deficiency individuals with MPL eat less and do not gain weight or develop symptoms of diabetes like insulin resistance. MPL patients burn less energy than normal individuals but also consume less and their net energy balance is moderately reduced. In contrast to MPL patients whose asprosin is undetectable in the blood individuals with obesity and diabetes have elevated levels of asprosin. As such FBN1 has been nicknamed the \"thin gene\" and drug development for targeted inhibition of asprosin signaling is considered to be an \"unusually promising\" potential therapeutic route in the treatment of obesity and diabetes."

        "article": "Amantadine sold under the brand name Gocovri among others is a medication used to treat dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism and influenza caused by type A influenzavirus though its use for the latter is no longer recommended because of widespread drug resistance. It acts as a nicotinic antagonist dopamine agonist and noncompetitive NMDA antagonist. The antiviral mechanism of action is antagonism of the influenzavirus A M2 proton channel which prevents endosomal escape (i.e. the release of viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm).Amantadine was first used for the treatment of influenza A. After its antiviral properties were initially reported in 1963 amantadine received approval for prophylaxis against the influenza virus A in 1976. In 1973 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2017 the extended-release formulation was approved for use in the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.Amantadine has a mild side-effect profile. Common neurological side effects include drowsiness lightheadedness dizziness and confusion. Because of its effects on the central nervous system it should be combined cautiously with additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Given that it is  cleared by the kidneys amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end stage kidney disease. Due to its anticholinergic effects it should be taken with caution by those with enlarged prostates or glaucoma."

Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis) gangrene of the extremities and sometimes kidney failure; problems with other organs may arise depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream. When the kidneys are involved the disease is referred to as atheroembolic renal disease. The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ. Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and giving supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis."

        "article": "Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs also known as antinuclear factor or ANF) are autoantibodies that bind to contents of the cell nucleus. In normal individuals the immune system produces antibodies to foreign proteins (antigens) but not to human proteins (autoantigens). In some cases antibodies to human antigens are produced.There are many subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro antibodies anti-La antibodies anti-Sm antibodies anti-nRNP antibodies anti-Scl-70 antibodies anti-dsDNA antibodies anti-histone antibodies antibodies to nuclear pore complexes  anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies. Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus. They are found in many disorders including autoimmunity cancer and infection with different prevalences of antibodies depending on the condition. This allows the use of ANAs in the diagnosis of some autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus Sj\u00f6gren syndrome scleroderma mixed connective tissue disease polymyositis dermatomyositis autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced lupus.The ANA test detects the autoantibodies present in an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for detecting and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In immunofluorescence the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution equal to or greater than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present."

Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.Since hair naturally grows in groupings of 1 to 4 hairs current techniques harvest and transplant hair \"follicular units\" in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking original hair orientation. This hair transplant procedure is called follicular unit transplantation (FUT).

The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977 and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980 making smallpox the only human disease to have been eradicated to date.The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting. This was followed by formation of ulcers in the mouth and a skin rash. Over a number of days the skin rash turned into the characteristic fluid-filled blisters with a dent in the center. The bumps then scabbed over and fell off leaving scars. The disease was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person or (rarely) via contaminated objects. Prevention was achieved mainly through the smallpox vaccine. Once the disease had developed certain antiviral medications could potentially have helped but such medications did not become available until after the disease was eradicated. The risk of death was about 30% with higher rates among babies. Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin and some were left blind.The earliest evidence of the disease dates to around 1500 BC in Egyptian mummies. The disease historically occurred in outbreaks. In 18th-century Europe it is estimated that 400000 people died from the disease per year and that one-third of all cases of blindness were due to smallpox. Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to 300\u00a0million people in the 20th century and around 500\u00a0million people in the last 100 years of its existence. Earlier deaths included six European monarchs including Louis XV of France in 1774. As recently as 1967 15\u00a0million cases occurred a year.Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the 1500s. Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the 18th century. In 1796 Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine. In 1967 the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease. Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated the other being rinderpest (a disease of even-toed ungulates) in 2011. The term \"smallpox\" was first used in England in the 16th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis which was then known as the \"great pox\". Other historical names for the disease include pox speckled monster and red plague."

It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries CML accounts for 15\u201325% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population where CML is less common)."

These two pathological processes compromise the normal function of bone marrow resulting in decreased production of blood cells such as erythrocytes (red cells) granulocytes and megakaryocytes the latter cells responsible for the production of platelets.Signs and symptoms include fever night sweats bone pain fatigue and abdominal pain.  Increased infections bleeding and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) are also hallmarks of the disease. Patients with myelofibrosis have an increased risk of acute meyloid leukemia and frank bone marrow failure.In 2016 prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis was formally classified as a distinct condition that progresses to overt PMF in many patients the primary diagnostic difference being the grade of fibrosis."

Some have argued that the terms \"dysplastic\" and \"atypical\" only refer to diagnostic uncertainty as opposed to biologic uncertainty and that the lesion is either a nevus or melanoma from the very beginning as opposed to some kind of \"premalignant stage\"; it is only the clinician who is unsure.

Melanoma is a group of serious skin cancers that arise from pigment cells (melanocytes); acral lentiginous melanoma is a kind of lentiginous skin melanoma. Acral lentiginous melanoma is the most common subtype in people with darker skins and is rare in people with lighter skin types. It is not caused by exposure to sunlight or UV radiation and wearing sunscreen does not protect against it. Acral lentiginous melanoma is commonly found on the palms soles under the nails and in the oral mucosa. It occurs on non-hair-bearing surfaces of the body which have not necessarily been exposed to sunlight. It is also found on mucous membranes.The absolute incidence of ALM is the same for people of all skin colors and has not changed significantly for decades. However because rates of other melanomas are low in non-white populations ALM is the most common form of melanoma diagnosed amongst Asian and sub-Saharan African ethnic groups.

Symptoms generally come on slowly and insidiously and may include abdominal pain and gastrointestinal abnormalities weakness and weight loss. Darkening of the skin in certain areas may also occur. Under certain circumstances an adrenal crisis may occur with low blood pressure vomiting lower back pain and loss of consciousness. Mood changes may also occur. Rapid onset of symptoms indicates acute adrenal  failure which is a clinical emergency. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by stress such as from an injury surgery or infection.Addison's disease arises from problems with the adrenal gland such that not enough of the steroid hormone cortisol and possibly aldosterone are produced. It is an autoimmune disease which affects some genetically predisposed people in whom the body's own immune system has started to target the adrenal gland. While it can follow tuberculosis in many adult cases it is unclear what has triggered onset of the disease. Causes can include certain medications sepsis and bleeding into both adrenal glands. Addison's disease is generally diagnosed by blood tests urine tests and medical imaging.Treatment involves replacing the absent hormones. This involves taking a synthetic corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone. These medications are usually taken orally (by mouth). Lifelong continuous steroid replacement therapy is required with regular follow-up treatment and monitoring for other health problems. A high-salt diet may also be useful in some people. If symptoms worsen an injection of corticosteroid is recommended (people need to carry a dose with them). Often large amounts of intravenous fluids with the sugar dextrose are also required. With appropriate treatment long-term outcomes are typically favorable and most people are able to lead a reasonably normal life.  Without treatment an adrenal crisis can result in death.Addison's disease affects about 9 to 14 per 100000 people in the developed world. It occurs most frequently in middle-aged females. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is more prevalent. The disease is named after Thomas Addison a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School who first described the condition in 1855."

In addition recent studies suggest that this virus may latently infect the human sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Most MCV viruses found in MCC tumors however have at least two mutations that render the virus nontransmissible: 1) The virus is integrated into the host genome and 2) The viral T antigen has truncation mutations that leave the T antigen unable to initiate DNA replication needed to propagate the virus.Evidence that MCV is the cause for most MCC tumors comes from studies in which T antigen oncoproteins from the virus are inhibited.  Knockdown of these viral proteins causes cells from MCV-positive MCC tumors to die whereas there is no effect on cells from tumors that are uninfected with the virus.  This indicates that MCV is necessary to maintain the virus-positive tumor cells.  Further clonal pattern of MCV insertions into MCC cell genomes indicates that the virus was present in the Merkel cell before it underwent cancerous transformation.  The IARC has recently classified MCV as a class 2A carcinogen."

        "article": "Strictureplasty (also spelled Stricturoplasty) is a surgical procedure performed to alleviate bowel narrowing due to scar tissue that has built up in the intestinal wall from inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn's disease. The scar tissue accumulates as a result of repeated damage and healing with the scarring causing a stricture (a narrowing of the lumen of the bowel). The narrowing can force bowel contents into fissures and ulcers at the site causing additional damage and narrowing. The surgery restores free flow through the bowel without the need for removing bowel segments (i.e. without bowel resection).Strictureplasty was first used in Crohn's disease patients about 30 years ago. The first strictureplasty for Crohn's disease was performed by Emanoel Lee in 1976 and was reported in 1982. The course of the following two decades several papers demonstrated that strictureplasties were safe and effective.Strictureplasties are categorized into three groups: Conventional intermediate and complex procedures.  The Heineke-Mikulicz Strictureplasty is the most common among the conventional stricutreplasties. Best-suited for short (up to 7 centimeters) strictures the H-M Strictureplasty is performed by making a cut lengthwise along one side of the bowel pushing the two ends of the cut together and then suturing the bowel widthwise (picture) thus having the effect of widening the segment of narrowed bowel therefore resolving the stricture.The Finney Strictureplasty is the most common intermediate strictureplasty. Indicated for strictures up to 15 centimeters the Finney Strictureplasty is performed by folding the diseased bowel on itself and creating a large opening between the two loops.For multiple strictures or for longer strictures neither the conventional nor the intermediate strictureplasties are suitable. In these cases surgeons need to use complex procedures. The most common complex strictureplasty is the Michelassi Strictureplasty. In this strictureplasty the long loop of the bowel affected by Crohn's is first divided at its midpoint. The two halves are then moved side to side. A very long opening is created between the two loops which are then sutured together (Figure 1) (Figure 2) (Figure 3) (Figure 4).Multiple strictureplasty can be performed in the same patient.  All strictureplasty techniques spare the patient from bowel resections an important consideration in a chronic recurrent intestinal condition or in patients with short gut. In addition recent data suggests that strictureplasty has a protective effect on disease recurrence.   Because of the reconfiguration of the bowel strictureplasty causes slight discontinuities in peristalsis visible in some imaging tests. "

The report given by the pathologist is often limited to a \"benign\" or \"malignant\" diagnosis and communicated to the surgeon operating via intercom. When operating on a previously confirmed malignancy the main purpose of the pathologist is to inform the surgeon if the resection margin is clear of residual cancer or if residual cancer is present at the resection margin. The method of processing is usually done with the bread loafing technique.

It falls under the category of gestational trophoblastic diseases. During a molar pregnancy the uterus contains a growing mass characterized by swollen chorionic villi resembling clusters of grapes. The occurrence of a molar pregnancy can be attributed to the fertilized egg lacking an original maternal nucleus. As a result the products of conception may or may not contain fetal tissue. These molar pregnancies are categorized into two types: partial moles and complete moles where the term 'mole' simply denotes a clump of growing tissue or a \u2018growthA complete mole is caused by either a single sperm (90% of the time) or two sperm (10% of the time) combining with an egg that has lost its DNA. In the former case the sperm reduplicates leading to the formation of a \"complete\" 46-chromosome set. Typically the genotype is 46XX (diploid) due to subsequent mitosis of the fertilizing sperm but it can also be 46XY (diploid). However 46YY (diploid) is not observed. On the other hand a partial mole occurs when a normal egg is fertilized by one or two sperm which then reduplicates itself resulting in genotypes of 69XXY (triploid) or 92XXXY (tetraploid).Complete moles carry a 2\u20134% risk in Western countries of developing into choriocarcinoma and a higher risk of 10\u201315% in Eastern countries with an additional 15% risk of becoming an invasive mole. In contrast incomplete moles can become invasive as well but are not associated with choriocarcinoma. Notably complete hydatidiform moles account for 50% of all cases of choriocarcinoma.Molar pregnancies are relatively rare complications of pregnancy occurring in approximately 1 in 1000 pregnancies in the United States while in Asia the rates are considerably higher reaching up to 1 in 100 pregnancies in countries like Indonesia."

Moles may be viewed as pests to gardeners but they provide positive contributions to soil gardens and ecosystems including soil aeration feeding on slugs and small creatures that eat plant roots and providing prey for other wildlife. They eat earthworms and other small invertebrates in the soil."

Its main current use in pharmacology is treating molluscum contagiosum and warts topically. It is a burn agent and poisonous in large doses and has been historically used as aphrodisiacs (Spanish fly). In its natural form cantharidin is secreted by the male blister beetle and given to the female as a copulatory gift during mating. Afterwards the female beetle covers her eggs with it as a defense against predators.Poisoning from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern especially in horses but it can also be poisonous to humans if taken internally (where the source is usually experimental self-exposure). Externally cantharidin is a potent vesicant (blistering agent) exposure to which can cause severe chemical burns. Properly dosed and applied the same properties have also been used therapeutically for instance for treatment of skin conditions such as molluscum contagiosum infection of the skin.Cantharidin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce store or use it in significant quantities."

Molluscum contagiosum affects about 200000 people a year about 1% of all diagnosed skin diseases. Diagnosis is based on the size and shape of the skin lesions and can be confirmed with a biopsy as the virus cannot be routinely cultured. Molluscum contagiosum virus is the only species in the genus Molluscipoxvirus.  MCV is a member of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae of family Poxviridae. Other commonly known viruses that reside in the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae are variola virus (cause of smallpox) and monkeypox virus.The poxvirus family uniquely contains both non-enveloped particles (mature virions) and enveloped particles (extracellular virions). The structure of the virions is consistent with that of others in the poxvirus family: they are composed of a nucleocapsid core envelope lateral body and an extracellular envelope. Like other poxviruses MCV is a DNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus. Because of this the virus must bring all necessary enzymes for replication with it or encode the enzymes in its genome."

The human vulva includes the mons pubis labia majora labia minora clitoris vulval vestibule urinary meatus vaginal opening hymen and Bartholin's and Skene's vestibular glands. The vulva includes the entrance to the vagina which leads to the uterus and provides a double layer of protection for this by the folds of the outer and inner labia. Pelvic floor muscles support the structures of the vulva. Other muscles of the urogenital triangle also give support.Blood supply to the vulva comes from the three pudendal arteries. The internal pudendal veins give drainage. Afferent lymph vessels carry lymph away from the vulva to the inguinal lymph nodes. The nerves that supply the vulva are the pudendal nerve perineal nerve ilioinguinal nerve and their branches. Blood and nerve supply to the vulva contribute to the stages of sexual arousal that are helpful in the reproduction process.Following the development of the vulva changes take place at birth childhood puberty menopause and post-menopause. There is a great deal of variation in the appearance of the vulva particularly in relation to the labia minora. The vulva can be affected by many disorders which may often result in irritation. Vulvovaginal health measures can prevent many of these. Other disorders include a number of infections and cancers. There are several vulval restorative surgeries known as genitoplasties and some of these are also used as cosmetic surgery procedures.Different cultures have held different views of the vulva. Some ancient religions and societies have worshipped the vulva and revered the female as a goddess. Major traditions in Hinduism continue this. In Western societies there has been a largely negative attitude typified by the medical terminology of pudenda membra meaning parts to be ashamed of. There has been an artistic reaction to this in various attempts to bring about a more positive and natural outlook such as work from British American and Japanese artists. While the vagina is a separate part of the anatomy it has often been used synonymously with vulva."

They usually deny consensus opinion and cannot be proven using historical or scientific methods and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies such as Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II.In principle conspiracy theories might not always be false and their validity depends on evidence as for any theory. However they are often implausible prima facie due to their convoluted and all-encompassing nature. Conspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other; they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them.Psychologists sometimes attribute proclivities toward conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia schizotypy narcissism and insecure attachment or to a form of cognitive bias called \"illusory pattern perception\". However the current scientific consensus holds that most conspiracy theorists are not pathological but merely exaggerate certain cognitive tendencies that are universal in the human brain and probably have deep evolutionary origins such as natural inclinations towards anxiety and agent detection."

        "article": "A wetsuit is a garment worn to provide thermal protection while wet. It is usually made of foamed neoprene and is worn by surfers divers windsurfers canoeists and others engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water.  Its purpose is to provide thermal insulation and protection from abrasion ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms.  It also contributes extra buoyancy.  The insulation properties of neoprene foam depend mainly on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density providing buoyancy in water.Hugh Bradner a University of California Berkeley physicist invented the modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed and later sandwiched with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later spandex (also known as lycra). Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing taping and blindstitching helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Further improvements in the seals at the neck wrists ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a \"semi-dry\".Different types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures. Suits range from a thin 2\u00a0mm or less \"shortie\" covering just the torso upper arm and thighs to thick 8\u00a0mm semi-dry suit covering the torso arms and legs usually complemented by neoprene boots gloves and hood.The difference between a wetsuit and a dry suit is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit though good fit limits water circulation inside the suit and between the inside and outside of the suit while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness.  Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters. Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to use but can be used where protection from lower temperatures or contaminated water is needed."

The submandibular gland is medial to the angle of the mandible and it drains its mixture of serous and mucous saliva via the submandibular duct (Wharton duct) into the mouth usually opening in a punctum in the floor of mouth. The sublingual gland is below the tongue on the floor of the mouth; it drains its mostly mucous saliva into the mouth via about 8\u201320 ducts which open along the plica sublingualis a fold of tissue under the tongue.The function of the salivary glands is to secrete saliva which has a lubricating function which protects the mucosa of the mouth during eating and speaking. Saliva also contains digestive enzymes (e.g. salivary amylase) has antimicrobial action and acts as a buffer. Salivary-gland dysfunction occurs when salivary rates are reduced; this can cause xerostomia (dry mouth).Some disorders affecting the salivary glands are listed below. Some are more common than others and they are considered according to a surgical sieve; but this list is not exhaustive. Sialadenitis is inflammation of a salivary gland usually caused by infections although there are other less common causes of inflammation such as irradiation allergic reactions and trauma."

Most people are infected by the virus as children when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults the disease often results in fever sore throat enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and fatigue. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur.While usually caused by the Epstein\u2013Barr virus also known as human herpesvirus 4 which is a member of the herpesvirus family a few other viruses and the protozoon Toxoplasma gondii may also cause the disease. It is primarily spread through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood. Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes or through a cough or sneeze. Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop. Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies. Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are atypical. The monospot test is not recommended for general use due to poor accuracy.There is no vaccine for EBV however there is ongoing research.  Infection can be prevented by not sharing personal items or saliva with an infected person. Mono generally improves without any specific treatment. Symptoms may be reduced by drinking enough fluids getting sufficient rest and taking pain medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen.Mononucleosis most commonly affects those between the ages of 15 and 24 years in the developed world. In the developing world people are more often infected in early childhood when there are fewer symptoms. In those between 16 and 20 it is the cause of about 8% of sore throats. About 45 out of 100000 people develop infectious mono each year in the United States. Nearly 95% of people have had an EBV infection by the time they are adults. The disease occurs equally at all times of the year. Mononucleosis was first described in the 1920s and is colloquially known as \"the kissing disease\"."

It most often occurs at the back of the wrist followed by the front of the wrist.The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve an outpouching of the synovial membrane. Diagnosis is typically based on examination. The ability to shine through the bump or any past decrease in size supports the diagnosis of the bump as a ganglion cyst. Ganglion cysts are usually obvious upon observation. Medical imaging may be considered on infrequent occasions to rule out another diagnosis.Treatment is not necessary. Options for treatment include needle aspiration or surgery. About half the time they resolve on their own. About three per 10000 people newly develop ganglion of the wrist or hand a year."

Odontogenic cysts are closed sacs and have a distinct membrane derived from rests of odontogenic epithelium. It may contain air fluids or semi-solid material. Intra-bony cysts are most common in the jaws because the mandible and maxilla are the only bones with epithelial components. That odontogenic epithelium is critical in normal tooth development. However epithelial rests may be the origin for the cyst lining later.Not all oral cysts are odontogenic cysts. For example mucous cyst of the oral mucosa and nasolabial duct cyst are not of odontogenic origin.In addition there are several conditions with so-called (radiographic) 'pseudocystic appearance' in jaws; ranging from anatomic variants such as Stafne static bone cyst to the aggressive aneurysmal bone cyst."

The sign is present when slight rubbing of the skin results in exfoliation of the outermost layer. A typical test would be to place the eraser of a pencil on the roof of a lesion and spin the pencil in a rolling motion between the thumb and forefinger. If the lesion is opened (i.e. skin sloughed off) then the Nikolsky's sign is present/positive.Nikolsky's sign is almost always present in Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome caused by the exfoliative toxin of Staphylococcus aureus. It is also associated with pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. It is useful in differentiating between the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris or mucous membrane pemphigoid (where the sign is present) and bullous pemphigoid (where it is absent).The Nikolsky sign is dislodgement of intact superficial epidermis by a shearing force indicating a plane of cleavage in the skin epidermal-epidermal junctions (e.g. desmosomes). The histological picture involves thinner weaker attachments of the skin lesion itself to the normal skin \u2013 resulting in easier dislodgement.The formation of new blisters upon slight pressure (direct Nikolsky) and shearing of the skin due to rubbing (indirect Nikolsky) is a sign of pemphigus vulgaris albeit not a 100% reliable diagnosis. In addition another physical exam the Asboe-Hansen signs must be used to determine the absence of intracellular connections holding epidermal cells together."

        "article": "Syphilis () is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary secondary latent and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm painless non-itchy skin ulceration usually between 1\u00a0cm and 2\u00a0cm in diameter) though there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis which can last for years there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths) neurological problems or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as \"the great imitator\" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.Syphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity. It may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth resulting in congenital syphilis. Other diseases caused by Treponema bacteria include yaws (T. pallidum subspecies pertenue) pinta (T. carateum) and nonvenereal endemic syphilis (T. pallidum subspecies endemicum). These three diseases are not typically sexually transmitted. Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) recommend all pregnant women be tested.The risk of sexual transmission of syphilis can be reduced by using a latex or polyurethane condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine benzylpenicillin injected into a muscle. In those who have a severe penicillin allergy doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis intravenous benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever headache and muscle pains a reaction known as Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer.In 2015 about 45.4\u00a0million people had syphilis infections of which six million were new cases. During 2015 it caused about 107000 deaths down from 202000 in 1990. After decreasing dramatically with the availability of penicillin in the 1940s rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries often in combination with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is believed to be partly due to increased sexual activity increased prostitution and decreased use of condoms."

It carries a 30\u00a0mm (1.18\u00a0in) M230 chain gun under its forward fuselage and four hardpoints on stub-wing pylons for armament and stores typically AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. Redundant systems help it survive combat damage.The Apache began as the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's Advanced Attack Helicopter program to replace the AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 first flew on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976 and later approved full production in 1982. After acquiring Hughes Helicopters in 1984 McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by Boeing Defense Space &amp; Security. As of 2020 more than 2400 AH-64s have been produced.Primarily operated by the U.S. Army the AH-64 has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations including Greece Japan Israel the Netherlands Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. It has been built under license in the United Kingdom as the AgustaWestland Apache. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in Panama the Persian Gulf Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq. Israel used the Apache to fight in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. British and Dutch Apaches were deployed to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001."

On 25 October 1854 the Light Brigade led by Lord Cardigan mounted a frontal assault against a Russian artillery battery which was well prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire. The charge was the result of a misunderstood order from the commander in chief Lord Raglan who had intended the Light Brigade to attack a different objective for which light cavalry was better suited to prevent the Russians from removing captured guns from overrun Turkish positions. The Light Brigade made its charge under withering direct fire and reached its target scattering some of the gunners but was forced to retreat immediately.The events were the subject of Alfred Lord Tennyson's narrative poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1854) published six weeks after the event. Its lines emphasise the valour of the cavalry in carrying out their orders regardless of the risk. Responsibility for the miscommunication is disputed as the order was vague and Captain Louis Nolan who delivered the written orders with some verbal interpretation was killed in the first minute of the assault."

By moving the guns from point-to-point during a battle enemy formations could be broken up to be handled by the infantry or cavalry wherever they were massing dramatically increasing the overall effectiveness of the attack."

This rebellion was formulated between the Indian revolutionary underground and exiled or self-exiled nationalists in the United States. It also involved the Ghadar Party and in Germany the Indian independence committee in the decade preceding the Great War. The conspiracy began at the start of the war with extensive support from the German Foreign Office the German consulate in San Francisco and some support from Ottoman Turkey and the Irish republican movement. The most prominent plan attempted to foment unrest and trigger a Pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army from Punjab to Singapore. It was to be executed in February 1915 and overthrow British rule in the Indian subcontinent. The February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement and arrested key figures. Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed.The Indo-German alliance and conspiracy were the target of a worldwide British intelligence effort which successfully prevented further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen affair in 1917. The conspiracy resulted in the Lahore conspiracy case trials in India as well as the Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy Trial \u2014 at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States.This series of events was pivotal for the Indian independence movement and became a major factor in reforming the Raj's Indian policy. Similar efforts were made during World War II in Germany and in Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia. Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indische Legion and the Indian National Army and in Italy Mohammad Iqbal Shedai formed the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan."

Aggregates of these cells in mycosis fungoides are known as a Pautrier's microabscesses. They are a form of T-lymphocytes that has been mutated  This atypical form of T-lymphocytes contains T-cell receptors on the surface and is found in both the dermis and epidermis layers of the skin. Since Lutzner cells are a mutated form of T-lymphocytes they develop in bone marrow and are transported to the thymus is order to mature. The production and maturation stages occur before the cell has developed a mutation. Lutzner cells can form cutaneous T-cell lymphoma which is a form of skin cancer."

During the Edo period of Japan kishu mikans were more popular because there was a popular superstition that eating Citrus unshiu without seeds made people prone to infertility. Citrus unshiu became popular in Japan after modernization started in the Meiji period. It was introduced to the West from the Satsuma region of Japan in 1878.Citrus unshiu was named after Unshu (Wenzhou) a famous production area of mandarin oranges in China in the late Edo period of Japan. Before the name unshu mikan was established in Japan it was called nakajima mikain or nagashima mikan after the place name of Nishi-Nakajima in Amakusa District of the Higo Province (later Nagashima Kagoshima) where the species was thought to have developed by mutation. It is said to have originated in either Japan or China and because of its name it is often described as originating in China. Genetic studies conducted in the 2010s suggest that the maternal species of Citrus unshiu is kishu (Citrus kinokuni) and the paternal species is kunenbo (Citrus nobilis Lour. var. kunip).Various cultivars have been developed based on the Citrus unshiu and in Japan three cultivars namely miyagawa wase okitsu wase and aoshima unshu account for nearly half of the production volume of Citrus unshiu."

The bone of the shell consists of both skeletal and dermal bone showing that the complete enclosure of the shell likely evolved by including dermal armor into the rib cage.The turtle's shell is an important study not just because of the apparent protection it provides for the animal but also as an identification tool in particular with fossils as the shell is one of the likely parts of a turtle to survive fossilization. Hence understanding the shell structure in living species provides comparable material with fossils.The shell of the hawksbill turtle among other species has been used as a material for a wide range of small decorative and practical items since antiquity but is normally referred to as tortoiseshell."

Generally nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include pins tacks brads spikes and cleats.Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer or nail gun. A nail holds materials together by friction in the axial direction and shear strength laterally. The point of the nail is also sometimes bent over or clinched after driving to prevent pulling out."

Singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator Atticus Ross joined in 2016. The band's debut album Pretty Hate Machine (1989) was released via TVT Records. After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP Broken (1992). The following albums The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999) were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.Following a hiatus Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album With Teeth (2005). Following the release of the next album Year Zero (2007) the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released Ghosts I\u2013IV (2008) and The Slip (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album Hesitation Marks (2013) was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs Not the Actual Events (2016) and Add Violence (2017) and their ninth album Bad Witch (2018). In 2020 Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further installments in the Ghosts series: Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts.When touring Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994) Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005) and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2009) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements complex special effects and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.Nine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards winning for the songs \"Wish\" in 1992 and \"Happiness in Slavery\" in 1996. Time magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997 while Spin magazine has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004 Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 after being nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015."

Symptoms may include white or yellow nail discoloration thickening of the nail and separation of the nail from the nail bed. Fingernails may be affected but it is more common for toenails. Complications may include cellulitis of the lower leg.A number of different types of fungus can cause onychomycosis including dermatophytes and Fusarium. Risk factors include athlete's foot other nail diseases exposure to someone with the condition peripheral vascular disease and poor immune function. The diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing.Onychomycosis does not necessarily require treatment. The antifungal medication terbinafine taken by mouth appears to be the most effective but is associated with liver problems. Trimming the affected nails when on treatment also appears useful.There is a ciclopirox-containing nail polish but there is no evidence that it works. The condition returns in up to half of cases following treatment. Not using old shoes after treatment may decrease the risk of recurrence.Onychomycosis occurs in about 10 percent of the adult population with older people more frequently affected. Males are affected more often than females. Onychomycosis represents about half of nail disease. It was first determined to be the result of a fungal infection in 1853 by Georg Meissner."

Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the diaper.Diapers are made of cloth or synthetic disposable materials. Cloth diapers are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton hemp bamboo microfiber or even plastic fibers such as PLA or PU and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use.Diapers are primarily worn by infants toddlers who are not yet toilet trained and by children who experience bedwetting. They are also used by adults under certain circumstances or with various conditions such as incontinence. Adult users can include those of advanced age patients bed-bound in a hospital individuals with certain types of physical or mental disability and people working in extreme conditions such as astronauts.

Talc in powdered form often combined with corn starch is used as baby powder. This mineral is used as a thickening agent and lubricant. It is an ingredient in ceramics paints and roofing material. It is a main ingredient in many cosmetics. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses and in an exceptionally rare crystal form. It has a perfect basal cleavage and an uneven flat fracture and it is foliated with a two-dimensional platy form.The Mohs scale of mineral hardness based on scratch hardness comparison defines value 1 as the hardness of talc the softest mineral. When scraped on a streak plate talc produces a white streak though this indicator is of little importance because most silicate minerals produce a white streak. Talc is translucent to opaque with colors ranging from whitish grey to green with a vitreous and pearly luster. Talc is not soluble in water and is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acids.Soapstone is a metamorphic rock composed predominantly of talc."

It is characterized by hardened raised areas of the skin often appearing on the shins with a yellowish center and a surrounding dark pink area. The lesions are generally asymptomatic but can become tender and ulcerate when injured.The exact cause of this condition is not known but it involves collagen degeneration and a granulomatous response in the layer of the skin called the dermis often affecting the deeper fat layer and thickening dermal blood vessels.Diagnosis is confirmed through a skin biopsy showing inflammatory cell infiltrate and necrotising vasculitis. Treatments like PUVA therapy photodynamic therapy low dose aspirin and corticosteroids are used to manage symptoms as there is no cure.It affects approximately 0.3% of diabetics showing a higher prevalence in women (3:1 female-to-male ratio)."

These regular whirly rings rapidly and repetitively appear within existing ones giving the impression that the rash is moving. The resulting pattern is similar to wood grain. There is often an intense itch and scale over the leading edge which may be slightly raised. The cause is believed to have an immunological base. 80% of cases have an underlying cancer of which almost half have lung cancer. Sometimes no cause is found. Diagnosis is generally by its appearance although tests may be required to exclude other conditions. These tests may include blood tests. A cancer may be located using medical imaging. Necrolytic migratory erythema and erythema migrans are some of many other skin conditions that may appear similar. Treatment and outlook depend on the underlying cause. Antihistamines may help to reduce the itch. The rash typically resolves with successful cancer treatment. The condition is rare. Males are affected twice as frequently as females. J. A. Gammel first described the condition in 1952."

        "article": "Glucagon is a peptide hormone produced by alpha cells of the pancreas. It raises the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body. It is also used as a medication to treat a number of health conditions. Its effect is opposite to that of insulin which lowers extracellular glucose. It is produced from proglucagon encoded by the GCG gene.The pancreas releases glucagon when the amount of glucose in the bloodstream is too low. Glucagon causes the liver to engage in glycogenolysis: converting stored glycogen into glucose which is released into the bloodstream. High blood-glucose levels on the other hand stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress. Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones."

        "article": "A paraneoplastic syndrome is a syndrome (a set of signs and symptoms) that is the consequence of a tumor in the body (usually a cancerous one). It is specifically due to the production of chemical signaling molecules (such as hormones or cytokines) by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Unlike a mass effect it is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle-aged to older people and they most commonly occur with cancers of the lung breast ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma). Sometimes the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis. In this paradigm tumor cells express tissue-restricted antigens (e.g. neuronal proteins) triggering an anti-tumor immune response which may be partially or rarely completely effective in suppressing tumor growth and symptoms. Patients then come to clinical attention when this tumor immune response breaks immune tolerance and begins to attack the normal tissue expressing that (e.g. neuronal) protein.The abbreviation PNS is sometimes used for paraneoplastic syndrome although it is used more often to refer to the peripheral nervous system."

Types include skin eye and mouth herpes (SEM) disseminated herpes (DIS) and central nervous system herpes (CNS). Depending on the type symptoms vary from a fever to small blisters irritability low body temperature lethargy breathing difficulty and a large abdomen due to ascites or large liver. There may be red streaming eyes or no symptoms.The cause is HSV 1 and 2. It can infect the unborn baby but more often passes to the baby during childbirth. Onset is typically in the first six weeks after birth. The baby is at greater risk of being affected if the mother contracts HSV in later pregnancy. In such scenarios a prolonged rupture of membranes or childbirth trauma may increase the risk further.Globally it is estimated to affect one in 10000 births. Around 1 in every 3500 babies in the United States contract the infection."

Risk factors in babies include birth by cesarean section preterm birth bottle feeding and being first born. The diagnosis may be made by feeling an olive-shaped mass in the baby's abdomen. This is often confirmed with ultrasound.Treatment initially begins by correcting dehydration and electrolyte problems.  This is then typically followed by surgery although some treat the condition without surgery by using atropine. Results are generally good both in the short term and in the long term.About one to two per 1000 babies are affected and males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition is very rare in adults. The first description of pyloric stenosis was in 1888 with surgery management first carried out in 1912 by Conrad Ramstedt.

The syndrome usually appears in cats after they've reached maturity with most cases first arising in cats between one and five years old.The condition is most commonly identified by frantic scratching biting or grooming of the lumbar area generally at the base of the tail and a rippling or rolling of the dorsal lumbar skin. These clinical signs usually appear in a distinct episode with cats returning to normal afterwards. During these episodes affected cats can be extremely difficult to distract from their behaviour and often appear to be absent-minded or in a trance-like state.

Habits are sometimes compulsory. A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency lack of awareness unintentionality and uncontrollability."

In dogs it results typically from the dog's urge to lick the lower portion of one of their legs.The lesion can initially be red swollen irritated and bleeding similar to a hot spot (wet eczema).  The animal's incessant licking of the lesion eventually results in a thickened firm oval plaque which is the granuloma.A major cause of lick granuloma appears to be psychological related to stress anxiety separation anxiety boredom or compulsiveness.  Lick granulomas are especially seen in active dogs left alone for long periods of time.  One theory about the cause of lick granulomas is that excessive licking causes endorphin release which reduces pain and makes the animal feel comfort temporarily. Other triggers include itchy skin painful conditions caused by trauma to the skin arthritis neuralgia and peripheral neuropathy. A bacterial or fungal infection of the skin can also trigger itching as can skin mites allergies a reaction to an environmental irritant or toxin hyperthyroidism and certain types of cancer.Treatment of the primary cause if known is essential.  In psychogenic cases psychological factors should be identified and addressed such as being left alone all day being confined and changes in the household."

A number of studies indicate a link with specific HLA genes. These genes aid the immune system in distinguishing between proteins produced by the body and those produced by outside threats. Some have proposed that an infection may first initiate the formation of autoantibodies and that subsequent infections increase their activity.There is currently no standard medication for Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome and treatment is dependent on the infection(s) present. Long-term antibiotic therapy and rituximab therapy have been used to manage Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome. Multiple treatments may be required at the same time."

This includes middle ear infections strep throat pneumonia traveler's diarrhea and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications it may also be used for malaria. It is administered by mouth into a vein or into the eye.Common side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea and upset stomach. An allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis or a type of diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile is possible. Azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatning arrythmias such as torsades de pointes. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein thereby stopping bacterial growth.Azithromycin was discovered in Croatia in 1980 by the pharmaceutical company Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization lists it as an example under \"Macrolides and ketolides\" in its Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine (designed to help manage antimicrobial resistance). It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names worldwide. In 2021 it was the 97th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 7\u00a0million prescriptions."

        "article": "Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB). It is named after its inventors Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin. In countries where tuberculosis or leprosy is common one dose is recommended in healthy babies as soon after birth as possible. In areas where tuberculosis is not common only children at high risk are typically immunized while suspected cases of tuberculosis are individually tested for and treated. Adults who do not have tuberculosis and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well. BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer.Rates of protection against tuberculosis infection vary widely and protection lasts up to 20 years. Among children it prevents about 20% from getting infected and among those who do get infected it protects half from developing disease. The vaccine is given by injection into the skin. No evidence shows that additional doses are beneficial.Serious side effects are rare. Often redness swelling and mild pain occur at the site of injection. A small ulcer may also form with some scarring after healing. Side effects are more common and potentially more severe in those with immunosuppression. Although no harmful effects on the fetus have been observed there is insufficient evidence about the safety of BCG vaccination during pregnancy and therefore the vaccine is not recommended for use during pregnancy. The vaccine was originally developed from Mycobacterium bovis which is commonly found in cattle. While it has been weakened it is still live.The BCG vaccine was first used medically in 1921. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2004 the vaccine is given to about 100 million children per year globally."

Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) release assays rely on the fact that T-lymphocytes will release IFN-\u03b3 when exposed to specific antigens.  These tests are mostly developed for the field of tuberculosis diagnosis but in theory may be used in the diagnosis of other diseases that rely on cell-mediated immunity e.g. cytomegalovirus and leishmaniasis and COVID-19.  For example in patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions the challenge of peripheral blood lymphocytes with the drug causing the reaction produced a positive test result for half of the drugs tested.There are currently two IFN-\u03b3 release assays available for the diagnosis of tuberculosis:QuantiFERON-TB Gold (licensed in US Europe and Japan); andT-SPOT.TB a form of ELISpot the variant of ELISA (licensed in Europe US Japan and China).The former test quantitates the amount of IFN-\u03b3 produced in response to the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are distinguishable from those present in BCG and most other non-tuberculous mycobacteria.  The latter test determines the total number of individual effector T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3.The indications for the test are still disputed.  It has been evaluated for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in HIV patients (who frequently have a negative Mantoux test).IFN-\u03b3 release assays for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19):The blood samples were collected in a set of lithium heparin tubes; The first tube without stimulation was left as a control; the second tube was stimulated with a single SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool for CD4+\u2005T cells and the third tube was stimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool for CD8+\u2005T cells; the fourth tube was stimulated with mitogen as positive control. A single CD4+\u2005T-cell mega pool (CD4+\u2005pool) consisted of 221 predicted HLA class II CD4+\u2005T-cell epitope peptides covering the entire viral proteome except for the spike protein which was covered with 253 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 residues and 2 CD8+\u2005T-cell mega pools (CD8+\u2005pools A and B) together consisting of 628 predicted HLA class I CD8+\u2005T-cell epitopes from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. After an overnight stimulation of the T-cells the IFN-\u03b3 concentration in the plasma fraction was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in international units per milliliter (IU/mL) (Murugesan et al 2021)."

She is a celebrated diarist who described everyday life from her family hiding place in an Amsterdam attic. One of the most-discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust she gained fame posthumously with the 1947 publication of The Diary of a Young Girl (originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch lit.\u2009'the back house'; English: The Secret Annex) in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 \u2014 it is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.Frank was born in Frankfurt Germany in 1929. In 1934 when she was four-and-a-half she and her family moved to Amsterdam Netherlands after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany. She spent most of her life in or around Amsterdam. By May 1940 the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. Anne lost her German citizenship in 1941 and became stateless. Despite spending most of her life in the Netherlands and being a de facto Dutch national she never officially became a Dutch citizen. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942 they went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father Otto Frank worked. The hiding place is notably referred to as the \"secret annex\". Until the family's arrest by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944 Frank kept and regularly wrote in a diary she had received as a birthday present in 1942.Following their arrest the Franks were transported to concentration camps. On 1 November 1944 Frank and her sister Margot were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where they died (presumably of typhus) a few months later. They were estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as the official date. Later research has alternatively suggested that they may have died in February or early March.Otto the only survivor of the Frank family returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that Anne's diary had been saved by his female secretaries Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. He decided to fulfil his daughter's greatest wish to become a writer. He published her diary in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl and has since been translated into over 70 languages."

The route was a new section of Norwegian National Road 50 between Rognan and Langset on the east side of Saltdal Fjord (Saltdalsfjorden) where there was a ferry service before the war. The specific incident that gave the road its name was a cross of blood that was painted on a rock cutting in June 1943. The blood came from a prisoner that was shot along the route and the cross was painted by his brother.:\u200a16\u200aThe prisoners lived in a primitive camp in the village of Botn just 2 kilometers (1.2\u00a0mi) outside Rognan. The prisoners of war had very small daily rations long working hours poor clothing for winter use primitive barracks and miserable sanitation and they were treated cruelly. The Botn camp was first led by the SS and under their direction mass executions were also carried out.When the Wehrmacht took over management of the Botn camp in October 1943 the conditions gradually improved. The conditions further improved when the Red Cross learned of the camps and several inspections were conducted.The Botn camp was one of five original prisoner-of-war camps in Northern Norway. The camp held prisoners from Yugoslavia the Soviet Union and Poland. The youngest prisoners of war were barely 12 years old. The conditions at all five camps were poor with high mortality. The number of prisoners in the Botn camp can only be estimated from testimonies of survivors. Almost 900 prisoners in total arrived at the camp; of these about half died through execution punishment malnutrition and exhaustion.By the war's end there were around 7500 prisoners of war in Saltdal but the number is uncertain. There were up to 18 camps from Saltfjellet (a mountain) and north to Saltdal Fjord but the treatment that prisoners received in these camps was considerably better. In the trials held after the war the camps were referred to as extermination camps. It shocked the Norwegian authorities that the Norwegian youths as young as 16 had served as guards in the camp. The youths were members of the Hirdvaktbataljon (Guard Battalion of the Hird) set up under the NS Ungdomsfylking (the Nasjonal Samling youth organization) and they treated the prisoners of war cruelly. In the postwar trials several Norwegian guards received prison sentences and some of the German SS officers were sentenced to death by firing squad."

The series was created by Heidi Thomas originally based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth who worked with the Community of St. John the Divine an Anglican religious order at their convent in the East End in London. The order was founded as a nursing order in 1849. The show's storylines have extended beyond the memoirs to include new historically-sourced material. For the most part it depicts the day-to-day lives of the midwives and those in their local neighbourhood of Poplar with certain historical events of the era having a direct or indirect effect on the characters and storylines.Call the Midwife achieved high ratings in its first series making it the most successful new drama series on BBC One since 2001. A total of twelve annual series of eight episodes each have aired subsequently year-on-year along with an annual Christmas special broadcast every Christmas Day since 2012. A 13th series is being broadcast. It is also broadcast in the United States on the PBS network; the first series started on 30 September 2012.Critical reception has been mostly positive and the series has won numerous awards and nominations. It has been praised for tackling topical subjects and contemporary social cultural and economic issues including nationalised healthcare infertility teen pregnancy adoption the importance of local community miscarriage and stillbirths abortion and unwanted pregnancies birth defects poverty common illnesses epidemic disease prostitution incest religion and faith racism and prejudice same-sex attraction and female genital mutilation.

The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother the timing and progress of the pregnancy and the health and development of the embryo or fetus.The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy and to assess for congenital malformations and multiple pregnancies (twins etc). Additionally the ISUOG recommends that pregnant patients who desire genetic testing have obstetric ultrasounds between 11 weeks' and 13 weeks 6 days' gestational age in countries with resources to perform them (the nuchal scan). Performing an ultrasound at this early stage of pregnancy can more accurately confirm the timing of the pregnancy and can also assess for multiple fetuses and major congenital abnormalities at an earlier stage. Research shows that routine obstetric ultrasound before 24 weeks' gestational age can significantly reduce the risk of failing to recognize multiple gestations and can improve pregnancy dating to reduce the risk of labor induction for post-dates pregnancy. There is no difference however in perinatal death or poor outcomes for infants."

Bleeding may be vaginal or less commonly into the abdominal cavity. Bleeding which occurs before 24 weeks is known as early pregnancy bleeding.Causes of bleeding before and during childbirth include cervicitis placenta previa placental abruption and uterine rupture. Causes of bleeding after childbirth include poor contraction of the uterus retained products of conception and bleeding disorders.About 8.7 million cases of severe maternal bleeding occurred in 2015 resulting in 83000 deaths. Between 2003 and 2009 bleeding accounted for 27% of maternal deaths globally."

The value of LD50 for a substance is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD50 figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's acute toxicity. A lower LD50 is indicative of higher toxicity.The term LD50 is generally attributed to John William Trevan. The test was created by J. W. Trevan in 1927. The term semilethal dose is occasionally used in the same sense in particular with translations of foreign language text but can also refer to a sublethal dose. LD50 is usually determined by tests on animals such as laboratory mice. In 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved alternative methods to LD50 for testing the cosmetic drug Botox without animal tests."

Myoclonus (myo- \"muscle\" clonus \"spasm\") describes a medical sign and generally is not a diagnosis of a disease. It belongs to the hyperkinetic movement disorders among tremor and chorea for example. These myoclonic twitches jerks or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or brief lapses of contraction (negative myoclonus).  The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk).  Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy people and are experienced occasionally by everyone.  However when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of various neurological disorders.  Hiccups are a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm.  When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a provoked spasm.  Shuddering attacks in babies fall in this category.Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur infrequently or many times each minute.  Most often myoclonus is one of several signs in a wide variety of nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis Parkinson's disease dystonia cerebral palsy Alzheimer's disease Gaucher's disease subacute sclerosing panencephalitis Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) serotonin toxicity some cases of Huntington's disease some forms of epilepsy and occasionally in intracranial hypotension.In almost all instances in which myoclonus is caused by central nervous system disease it is preceded by other symptoms; for instance in CJD it is generally a late-stage clinical feature that appears after the patient has already started to exhibit gross neurological deficits.Anatomically myoclonus may originate from lesions of the cortex subcortex or spinal cord.  The presence of myoclonus above the foramen magnum effectively excludes spinal myoclonus; further localisation relies on further investigation with electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG)."

It is known colloquially as a trapped nerve though this may also refer to nerve root compression (by a herniated disc for example). Its symptoms include pain tingling numbness and muscle weakness. The symptoms affect just one particular part of the body depending on which nerve is affected. The diagnosis is largely clinical and can be confirmed with diagnostic nerve blocks. Occasionally imaging and electrophysiology studies aid in the diagnosis. Timely diagnosis is important as untreated chronic nerve compression may cause permanent damage. A surgical nerve decompression can relieve pressure on the nerve but cannot always reverse the physiological changes that occurred before treatment. Nerve injury by a single episode of physical trauma is in one sense an acute compression neuropathy but is not usually included under this heading as chronic compression takes a unique pathophysiological course."

        "article": "In molecular biology reading frames are defined as spans of DNA sequence between the start and stop codons. Usually this is considered within a studied region of a prokaryotic DNA sequence where only one of the six possible reading frames will be \"open\" (the \"reading\" however refers to the RNA produced by transcription of the DNA and its subsequent interaction with the ribosome in translation). Such an ORF may contain a start codon (usually AUG in terms of RNA) and by definition cannot extend beyond a stop codon (usually UAA UAG or UGA in RNA). That start codon (not necessarily the first) indicates where translation may start. The transcription termination site is located after the ORF beyond the translation stop codon. If transcription were to cease before the stop codon an incomplete protein would be made during translation.In eukaryotic genes with multiple exons introns are removed and exons are then joined together after transcription to yield the final mRNA for protein translation. In the context of gene finding the start-stop definition of an ORF therefore only applies to spliced mRNAs not genomic DNA since introns may contain stop codons and/or cause shifts between reading frames. An alternative definition says that an ORF is a sequence that has a length divisible by three and is bounded by stop codons. This more general definition can be useful in the context of transcriptomics and metagenomics where a start or stop codon may not be present in the obtained sequences. Such an ORF corresponds to parts of a gene rather than the complete gene."

The camera and instruments are inserted into the patient's chest cavity through small incisions in the chest wall usually via specially designed guiding tubes known as \"ports\".VATS procedures are done using either conventional surgical instruments or laparoscopic instruments.  Unlike with laparoscopy carbon dioxide insufflation is not generally required in VATS due to the inherent rigidity of the thoracic cage.  However lung deflation on the side of the operated chest is a must to be able to visualize and pass instruments into the thorax; this is usually effected with a double-lumen endotracheal tube that allows for single-lung ventilation or a one-side bronchial occlusion delivered via a standard single-lumen tracheal tube."

It is thought to occur due to abnormal pressure or mechanical stress chronically applied to the foot usually with concomitant predisposing conditions such as peripheral sensory neuropathy peripheral motor neuropathy autonomic neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease.  It is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and it is a type of diabetic foot disease. Secondary complications to the ulcer such as infection of the skin or subcutaneous tissue bone infection gangrene or sepsis are possible often leading to amputation. Wound healing is an innate mechanism of action that works reliably most of the time. A key feature of wound healing is stepwise repair of lost extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms the largest component of the dermal skin layer. But in some cases certain disorders or physiological insult disturbs the wound healing process. Diabetes mellitus is one such metabolic disorder that impedes the normal steps of the wound healing process. Many studies show a prolonged inflammatory phase in diabetic wounds which causes a delay in the formation of mature granulation tissue and a parallel reduction in wound tensile strength.Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers should include: blood sugar control removal of dead tissue from the wound wound dressings and removing pressure from the wound through techniques such as total contact casting. Surgery in some cases may improve outcomes. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also help but is expensive.It occurs in 34% of people with diabetes during their lifetimes and it is associated with a high morbidity and mortality with 84% of all diabetes-related lower-leg amputations associated with a diabetic foot ulcer formation."

Both acquired or inherited lipodystrophy present as loss of adipose tissues in the absence of nutritional deprivation. The near-total loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue is termed generalized lipodystrophy while the selective loss of adipose tissues is denoted as partial lipodystrophy. Thus as the name suggests AGL is a near-total deficiency of adipose tissues in the body that is developed later in life. It is an extremely rare disease with only about 100 cases reported worldwide. There are three main etiologies of AGL suspected: autoimmune panniculitis-associated or idiopathic. After its onset the disease progresses over a few days weeks months or even in years. Clinical presentations of AGL are similar to other lipodystrophies including metabolic complications and hypoleptinemia. Treatments are also similar and mainly supportive for symptomatic alleviation. Although HIV- or drug-induced lipodystrophy are types of acquired lipodystrophy their origins are very specific and distinct and hence are usually not discussed with AGL (see HIV-associated lipodystrophy)."

Onset of lung problems is typically between 20 and 50 years of age. This may result in shortness of breath wheezing or an increased risk of lung infections. Complications may include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cirrhosis neonatal jaundice or panniculitis.A1AD is due to a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene that results in not enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT). Risk factors for lung disease include tobacco smoking and environmental dust. The underlying mechanism involves unblocked neutrophil elastase and buildup of abnormal A1AT in the liver. It is autosomal co-dominant meaning that one defective allele tends to result in milder disease than two defective alleles. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by blood tests or genetic tests.Treatment of lung disease may include bronchodilators inhaled steroids and when infections occur antibiotics. Intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or in severe disease lung transplantation may also be recommended. In those with severe liver disease liver transplantation may be an option. Avoiding smoking is recommended. Vaccination for influenza pneumococcus and hepatitis is also recommended. Life expectancy among those who smoke is 50 years while among those who do not smoke it is almost normal.The condition affects about 1 in 2500 people of European descent. Severe deficiency occurs in about 1 in 5000. In Asians it is uncommon. About 3% of people with COPD are believed to have the condition. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was first described in the 1960s."

        "article": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver; it is a type of viral hepatitis. It can cause both acute and chronic infection.Many people have no symptoms during an initial infection. For others symptoms may appear 30 to 180 days after becoming infected and can include a rapid onset of sickness with nausea vomiting yellowish skin fatigue dark urine and abdominal pain. Symptoms during acute infection typically last for a few weeks though some people may feel sick for up to six months. Deaths resulting from acute stage HBV infections are rare. An HBV infection lasting longer than six months is usually considered chronic. The likelihood of developing chronic hepatitis B is higher for those who are infected with HBV at a younger age. About 90% of those infected during or shortly after birth develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five develop chronic cases. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however cirrhosis and liver cancer eventually develop in about 25% of those with chronic HBV.The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. In areas where the disease is common infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood are the most frequent methods by which hepatitis B is acquired. In areas where the disease is rare intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare blood transfusions dialysis living with an infected person travel in countries with high infection rates and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however this has become less common with improved sterilization. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands sharing eating utensils kissing hugging coughing sneezing or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A B C D and E. During an initial infection care is based on a person's symptoms. In those who develop chronic disease antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes recommended for cases of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatitis B infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. As of 2022 the hepatitis B vaccine is between 98% and 100% effective in preventing infection. The vaccine is administered in several doses; after an initial dose two or three more vaccine doses are required at a later time for full effect. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends infants receive the vaccine within 24 hours after birth when possible. National programs have made the hepatitis B vaccine available for infants in 190 countries as of the end of 2021. To further prevent infection the WHO recommends testing all donated blood for hepatitis B before using it for transfusion. Using antiviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission is also recommended as is following safe sex practices including the use of condoms. In 2016 the WHO set a goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a threat to global public health by 2030. Achieving this goal would require the development of therapeutic treatments to cure chronic hepatitis B as well as preventing its transmission and using vaccines to prevent new infections.An estimated 296 million people or 3.8% of the global population had chronic hepatitis B infections as of 2019. Another 1.5 million developed acute infections that year and 820000 deaths occurred as a result of HBV. Cirrhosis and liver cancer are responsible for most HBV-related deaths. The disease is most prevalent in Africa (affecting 7.5% of the continent's population) and in the Western Pacific region (5.9%). Infection rates are 1.5% in Europe and 0.5% in the Americas. According to some estimates about a third of the world's population has been infected with hepatitis B at one point in their lives. Hepatitis B was originally known as \"serum hepatitis\". "

Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one. If given to those who are not immune within five days of exposure to chickenpox it prevents most cases of disease. Vaccinating a large portion of the population also protects those who are not vaccinated. It is given by injection just under the skin. Another vaccine known as zoster vaccine is used to prevent diseases caused by the same virus \u2013 the varicella zoster virus.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends routine vaccination only if a country can keep more than 80% of people vaccinated. If only 20% to 80% of people are vaccinated it is possible that more people will get the disease at an older age and outcomes overall may worsen. Either one or two doses of the vaccine is recommended. In the United States two doses are recommended starting at twelve to fifteen months of age. As of 2017 twenty-three countries recommend all non-medically exempt children receive the vaccine nine recommend it only for high risk groups three additional countries recommend use in only parts of the country while other countries make no recommendation. Not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost. In the United Kingdom Varilrix a live viral vaccine is approved from the age of 12 months but only recommended for certain at risk groups. Minor side effects may include pain at the site of injection fever and rash. Severe side effects are rare and occur mostly in those with poor immune function. Its use in people with HIV/AIDS should be done with care. It is not recommended during pregnancy; however the few times it has been given during pregnancy no problems resulted. The vaccine is available either by itself or along with the MMR vaccine in a version known as the MMRV vaccine. It is made from weakened virus.A live attenuated varicella vaccine the Oka strain was developed by Michiaki Takahashi and his colleagues in Japan in the early 1970s. American vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman's team developed a chickenpox vaccine in the United States in 1981 based on the \"Oka strain\" of the varicella virus. The chickenpox vaccine first became commercially available in 1984. It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines."

Most people with PMR wake up in the morning with pain in their muscles; however cases have occurred in which the person has developed the pain during the evenings or has pain and stiffness all day long.People who have polymyalgia rheumatica may also have temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) an inflammation of blood vessels in the face which can cause blindness if not treated quickly. The pain and stiffness can result in a lowered quality of life and can lead to depression. It is thought to be brought on by a viral or bacterial illness or trauma of some kind but genetics play a role as well. Persons of Northern European descent are at greater risk. There is no definitive laboratory test but C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be useful.PMR is usually treated with corticosteroids taken by mouth. Most people need to continue the corticosteroid treatment for two to three years. PMR sometimes goes away on its own in a year or two but medications and self-care measures can improve the rate of recovery.PMR was first established as a distinct disease in 1966 by a case report on 11 patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.

It can occur when the mother has a  pre-existing disease or becomes infected during pregnancy. Nutritional deficiencies may exacerbate the risks of perinatal infections. Vertical transmission is important for the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases especially for diseases of animals with large litter sizes as it causes a wave of new infectious individuals."

The corona overhangs a mucosal surface known as the neck of the penis which separates the shaft and the glans. The deep retro-glandular coronal sulcus forms between the corona and the neck of the penis. The two sides of the corona merge on the ventral midline forming the septum glandis. The circumference of the corona is richly innervated and is described as a highly erogenous area of the glans."

        "article": "In human anatomy the penis (; pl.: penises or penes; from the Latin p\u0113nis initially \"tail\") is an external male sex organ (intromittent organ) that additionally serves as the urinary duct. The main parts are the root body the epithelium of the penis including the shaft skin and the foreskin covering the glans. The body of the penis is made up of three columns of tissue: two corpora cavernosa on the dorsal side and corpus spongiosum between them on the ventral side. The urethra passes through the prostate gland where it is joined by the ejaculatory duct and then through the penis. The urethra goes across the corpus spongiosum and ends at the tip of the glans as the opening the urinary meatus. It is a passage both for excretion of urine and the ejaculation of semen.An erection is the stiffening expansion and orthogonal reorientation of the penis which occurs during sexual arousal. Erections can occur in non-sexual situations; spontaneous non-sexual erections frequently occur during adolescence and sleep. In its flaccid state the penis is smaller gives to pressure and the glans is covered by the foreskin. In its fully erect state the shaft becomes rigid and the glans becomes engorged but not rigid. An erect penis may be straight or curved and may point at an upward angle a downward angle or straight ahead. As of 2015 the average erect human penis is 13.12\u00a0cm (5.17\u00a0in) long and has a circumference of 11.66\u00a0cm (4.59\u00a0in). Neither age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicts erectile length. There are several common body modifications to the penis including circumcision and piercings.The penis is homologous to the clitoris in females."

In developed countries infestations are only a problem in areas of poverty where there is poor body hygiene crowded living conditions and a lack of access to clean clothing. Outbreaks can also occur in situations where large groups of people are forced to live in unsanitary conditions.

        "article": "Head lice infestation also known as pediculosis capitis is the infection of the head hair and scalp by the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis). Itching from lice bites is common. During a person's first infection the itch may not develop for up to six weeks. If a person is infected again symptoms may begin much more quickly. The itch may cause problems with sleeping. Generally however it is not a serious condition. While head lice appear to spread some other diseases in Africa they do not appear to do so in Europe or North America.Head lice are spread by direct contact with the hair of someone who is infected. The cause of head lice infestations in children is not related to cleanliness. Other animals such as cats and dogs do not play a role in transmission. Head lice feed only on human blood and are only able to survive on human head hair. When adults they are about 2 to 3 mm long. When not attached to a human they are unable to live beyond three days. Humans can also become infected with two other lice \u2013 the body louse and the crab louse. To make the diagnosis live lice must be found. Using a comb can help with detection. Empty eggshells (known as nits) are not sufficient for the diagnosis.Possible treatments include: combing the hair frequently with a fine tooth comb or shaving the head completely. A number of topical medications are also effective including malathion ivermectin and dimethicone. Dimethicone which is a silicone oil is often preferred due to the low risk of side effects. Pyrethroids such as permethrin have been commonly used; however they have become less effective due to increasing pesticide resistance. There is little evidence for alternative medicines.Head-lice infestations are common especially in children. In Europe they infect between 1 and 20% of different groups of people. In the United States between 6 and 12 million children are infected a year. They occur more often in girls than boys. It has been suggested that historically head lice infection were beneficial as they protected against the more dangerous body louse. Infestations may cause stigmatization of the infected individual."

However the number of cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s reaching hundreds of millions annually. There is no product or method that assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment. However there are a number of treatment modalities that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments natural products combs shaving hot air and silicone-based lotions.Treatment is recommended only after a clear diagnosis since all treatments have potential side effects. Louse eggs hatch 6\u20139 days after oviposition. Therefore a common recommendation is to repeat treatment with a pediculicide at least once after 10 days when all lice have hatched. Between the two treatments (Days 2\u20139) the person will still be infested with lice that hatch from eggs not killed by the anti-louse product. Between the treatments it is advised to wet the hair and comb daily with a louse-comb to remove the hatching lice. If no living lice are found the treatment was successful even if nits (eggs) are visible on the hair. If living lice are still present the treatment is repeated using an anti-louse product with a different active ingredient. This is kept in the hair for 2 hours and then rinsed out with the head and hair cleaned before sleep. Prophylactic treatment with pediculicides is not recommended."

        "article": "Bipolar disorder previously known as manic depression is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood that each last from days to weeks. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis it is called mania; if it is less severe and does not significantly affect functioning it is called hypomania. During mania an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic happy or irritable and they often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually also a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression the individual may experience crying and have a negative outlook on life and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide is high; over a period of 20 years 6% of those with bipolar disorder died by suicide while 30\u201340% engaged in self-harm. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorders are commonly associated with bipolar disorder.While the causes of this mood disorder are not clearly understood both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role. Many genes each with small effects may contribute to the development of the disorder. Genetic factors account for about 70\u201390% of the risk of developing bipolar disorder. Environmental risk factors include a history of childhood abuse and long-term stress. The condition is classified as bipolar I disorder if there has been at least one manic episode with or without depressive episodes and as bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no full manic episodes) and one major depressive episode. It is classified as cyclothymia if there are hypomanic episodes with periods of depression that do not meet the criteria for major depressive episodes.If these symptoms are due to drugs or medical problems they are not diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Other conditions that have overlapping symptoms with bipolar disorder include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder personality disorders schizophrenia and substance use disorder as well as many other medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis though blood tests or medical imaging can rule out other problems.Mood stabilizers\u2014lithium and certain anticonvulsants such as valproate and carbamazepine as well as atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole\u2014are the mainstay of long-term pharmacologic relapse prevention. Antipsychotics are additionally given during acute manic episodes as well as in cases where mood stabilizers are poorly tolerated or ineffective. In patients where compliance is of concern long-acting injectable formulations are available. There is some evidence that psychotherapy improves the course of this disorder. The use of antidepressants in depressive episodes is controversial: they can be effective but have been implicated in triggering manic episodes. The treatment of depressive episodes therefore is often difficult. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is effective in acute manic and depressive episodes especially with psychosis or catatonia. Admission to a psychiatric hospital may be required if a person is a risk to themselves or others; involuntary treatment is sometimes necessary if the affected person refuses treatment.Bipolar disorder occurs in approximately 2% of the global population. In the United States about 3% are estimated to be affected at some point in their life; rates appear to be similar in females and males. Symptoms most commonly begin between the ages of 20 and 25 years old; an earlier onset in life is associated with a worse prognosis. Interest in functioning in the assessment of patients with bipolar disorder is growing with an emphasis on specific domains such as work education social life family and cognition. Around one-quarter to one-third of people with bipolar disorder have financial social or work-related problems due to the illness. Bipolar disorder is among the top 20 causes of disability worldwide and leads to substantial costs for society. Due to lifestyle choices and the side effects of medications the risk of death from natural causes such as coronary heart disease in people with bipolar disorder is twice that of the general population."

Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and throat. Other symptoms may include soreness and problems swallowing. When it affects the vagina it may be referred to as a yeast infection or thrush. Signs and symptoms include genital itching burning and sometimes a white \"cottage cheese-like\" discharge from the vagina. Yeast infections of the penis are less common and typically present with an itchy rash. Very rarely yeast infections may become invasive spreading to other parts of the body. This may result in fevers among other symptoms.More than 20 types of Candida may cause infection with Candida albicans being the most common. Infections of the mouth are most common among children less than one month old the elderly and those with weak immune systems. Conditions that result in a weak immune system include HIV/AIDS the medications used after organ transplantation diabetes and the use of corticosteroids. Other risk factors include during breastfeeding following antibiotic therapy and the wearing of dentures. Vaginal infections occur more commonly during pregnancy in those with weak immune systems and following antibiotic therapy. Individuals at risk for invasive candidiasis include low birth weight babies people recovering from surgery people admitted to intensive care units and those with an otherwise compromised immune system.Efforts to prevent infections of the mouth include the use of chlorhexidine mouthwash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. Oral or intravenous fluconazole itraconazole or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk antifungal medications may be used preventively and concomitantly with medications known to precipitate infections.Infections of the mouth occur in about 6% of babies less than a month old. About 20% of those receiving chemotherapy for cancer and 20% of those with AIDS also develop the disease. About three-quarters of women have at least one yeast infection at some time during their lives. Widespread disease is rare except in those who have risk factors."

The slowing of heart rate and breathing is called the bradycardic response. It is not true that babies are born with the ability to swim though they have primitive reflexes that make it look like they are. Newborns are not old enough to hold their breath intentionally or strong enough to keep their head above water and cannot swim unassisted.Most infants though not all will reflexively hold their breath when submerged to protect their airway and are able to survive immersion in water for short periods of time. Infants can also be taken to swimming lessons. Although this may be done to reduce their risk of drowning the effects on drowning risk are not reliable.Babies can imitate swimming motions and reflexes but are not yet physically capable of swimming.A submersion of the head may last only a few seconds. A German physician pointed out the health risks of infant diving and the sometimes serious consequences as early as 1986 writing that since the introduction of baby swimming in Germany several hundred infants had died from brain complications as a result of sinusitis and otitis that occurred after diving. Pediatricians also reported cases of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure."

First introduced in the 1950s it is primarily effective for tremors such as those associated with Parkinson's disease where a selected portion of the thalamus is surgically destroyed (ablated).  Neurosurgeons use specialized equipment to precisely locate an area of the thalamus usually choosing to work on only one side (the side opposite that of the worst tremors).  Bilateral procedures are poorly tolerated because of increased complications and risk including vision and speech problems.  The positive effects on tremors are immediate.  Other less destructive procedures are sometimes preferred such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation since this procedure can also improve tremors and other symptoms of PD."

        "article": "Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant medication used to prevent rejection following organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease and lupus. Specifically it is used following kidney heart and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil.Common side effects include nausea infections and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine.Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020 it was the 313th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 900\u00a0thousand prescriptions."

        "article": "Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin. Pemphigus foliaceus causes a characteristic inflammatory attack at the subcorneal layer of epidermis which results in skin lesions that are scaly or crusted erosions with an erythematous (red) base. Mucosal involvement is absent even with widespread disease.If there is an autoimmune IgG buildup in the epidermis then nearly all of the antibodies are aimed against desmoglein 1. The effect of the antibodies and the immunological pathway is most likely one of three mechanisms:Steric hindrance of the desmoglein 1: The antibody caps off the site for intracellular binding to another keratinocyte.Activation of an endocytic pathway: The antibody activates a pathway which causes an internalization of desmogle\u00efn 1 which in turn causes a loss of adhesion.Disruption of function: In this case the antibody blocks the desmoglein 1 from being formed into a desmosome. This in turn causes a loss of adhesion with acantholysis as a result."

        "article": "Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare chronic blistering skin disease and the most common form of pemphigus. Pemphigus was derived from the Greek word pemphix meaning blister. It is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction in which antibodies are formed against desmosomes components of the skin that function to keep certain layers of skin bound to each other.  As desmosomes are attacked the layers of skin separate and the clinical picture resembles a blister. These blisters are due to acantholysis or breaking apart of intercellular connections through an autoantibody-mediated response. Over time the condition inevitably progresses without treatment: lesions increase in size and distribution throughout the body behaving physiologically like a severe burn.Before the advent of modern treatments mortality for the disease was close to 90%.  Today the mortality rate with treatment is between 5-15% due to the introduction of corticosteroids as primary treatment. Nevertheless in 1998 pemphigus vulgaris was the fourth most common cause of death due to a skin disorder. It is thus still deemed \"potentially fatal\".The disease mainly affects middle-aged and older adults between 50 and 60 years old. There has historically been a higher incidence in women."

        "article": "A BRCA mutation is a mutation in either of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which are tumour suppressor genes. Hundreds of different types of mutations in these genes have been identified some of which have been determined to be harmful while others have no proven impact. Harmful mutations in these genes may produce a hereditary breast\u2013ovarian cancer syndrome in affected persons. Only 5\u201310% of breast cancer cases in women are attributed to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (with BRCA1 mutations being slightly more common than BRCA2 mutations) but the impact on women with the gene mutation is more profound. Women with harmful mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a risk of breast cancer that is about five times the normal risk and a risk of ovarian cancer that is about ten to thirty times normal. The risk of breast and ovarian cancer is higher for women with a high-risk BRCA1 mutation than with a BRCA2 mutation. Having a high-risk mutation does not guarantee that the woman will develop any type of cancer or imply that any cancer that appears was actually caused by the mutation rather than some other factor.High-risk mutations which disable an important error-free DNA repair process (homology directed repair) significantly increase the person's risk of developing breast cancer ovarian cancer and certain other cancers. Why BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations lead preferentially to cancers of the breast and ovary is not known but lack of BRCA1 function seems to lead to non-functional X-chromosome inactivation. Not all mutations are high-risk; some appear to be harmless variations.  The cancer risk associated with any given mutation varies significantly and depends on the exact type and location of the mutation and possibly other individual factors.Mutations can be inherited from either parent and may be passed on to both sons and daughters.  Each child of a genetic carrier regardless of sex has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the parent who carries the mutation. As a result half of the people with BRCA gene mutations are male who would then pass the mutation on to 50% of their offspring male or female.  The risk of BRCA-related breast cancers for men with the mutation is higher than for other men but still low. However BRCA mutations can increase the risk of other cancers such as colon cancer pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer.Methods to diagnose the likelihood of a patient with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 getting cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics. Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led to Myriad growing from being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit.Biallelic and homozygous inheritance of a BRCA gene leads to a severe form of Fanconi anemia and is embryonically lethal in the majority of the cases."

        "article": "Menopause also known as the climacteric is the time when menstrual periods permanently stop marking the end of reproduction. It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 although the exact timing can vary. Menopause is usually a natural change. It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries or some types of chemotherapy. At the physiological level menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. While typically not needed a diagnosis of menopause can be confirmed by measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine. Menopause is the opposite of menarche the time when a girl's periods start.In the years before menopause a woman's periods typically become irregular which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow. During this time women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering night sweats and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes can recur for four to five years. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness trouble sleeping and mood changes. The severity of symptoms varies between women.Menopause before the age of 45 years is considered to be \"early menopause\" and when ovarian failure/surgical removal of the ovaries occurs before the age of 40 years this is termed \"premature ovarian insufficiency\".In addition to symptoms (hot flushes/flashes night sweats mood changes arthralgia and vaginal dryness) the physical consequences of menopause include bone loss increased central abdominal fat and adverse changes in a woman's cholesterol profile and vascular function. These changes predispose postmenopausal women to increased risks of osteoporosis and bone fracture and of cardio-metabolic disease (diabetes and cardiovascular disease).Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have functioning ovaries menopause is not considered to have yet occurred. Following the removal of the uterus symptoms of menopause typically occur earlier. Iatrogenic menopause occurs when both ovaries are surgically removed along with uterus for medical reasons.The primary indications for treatment of menopause are symptoms and prevention of bone loss. Mild symptoms may be improved with treatment. With respect to hot flashes avoiding smoking caffeine and alcohol is often recommended; sleeping naked in a cool room and using a fan may help. The most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Non-hormonal therapies for hot flashes include cognitive-behavioral therapy clinical hypnosis gabapentin fezolinetant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These will not improve symptoms such as joint pain or vaginal dryness which affect over 55% of women. Exercise may help with sleeping problems. Many of the concerns about the use of MHT raised by older studies are no longer considered barriers to MHT in healthy women. High-quality evidence for the effectiveness of alternative medicine has not been found."

Often the cause can be determined based on symptoms and examination. Blood tests may be done to rule out low thyroid or high prolactin. Other tests may include mammography breast ultrasound breast biopsy or skin biopsy.Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Duct ectasia may be treated with surgical removal of the ducts involved. Infectious causes may require antibiotics or incision and drainage. Nipple discharge is the third most common breast complaint by women after breast pain and a breast lump.

It is a progestogen and is used in combination with estrogens mainly in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low sex hormone levels in women. It is also used in women to support pregnancy and fertility and to treat gynecological disorders. Progesterone can be taken by mouth vaginally and by injection into muscle or fat among other routes. A progesterone vaginal ring and progesterone intrauterine device used for birth control also exist in some areas of the world.Progesterone is well tolerated and often produces few or no side effects. However a number of side effects are possible for instance mood changes. If progesterone is taken by mouth or at high doses certain central side effects including sedation sleepiness and cognitive impairment can also occur. The medication is a naturally occurring progestogen and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) the biological target of progestogens like endogenous progesterone. It opposes the effects of estrogens in various parts of the body like the uterus and also blocks the effects of the hormone aldosterone. In addition progesterone has neurosteroid effects in the brain.Progesterone was first isolated in pure form in 1934. It first became available as a medication later that year. Oral micronized progesterone (OMP) which allowed progesterone to be taken by mouth was introduced in 1980. A large number of synthetic progestogens or progestins have been derived from progesterone and are used as medications as well. Examples include medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone. In 2021 it was the 167th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 3\u00a0million prescriptions."

A progestin is a synthetic progestogen. Progestogens are used most commonly in hormonal birth control and menopausal hormone therapy. They can also be used in the treatment of gynecological conditions to support fertility and pregnancy to lower sex hormone levels for various purposes and for other indications. Progestogens are used alone or in combination with estrogens. They are available in a wide variety of formulations and for use by many different routes of administration. Examples of progestogens include natural or bioidentical progesterone as well as progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone.Side effects of progestogens include menstrual irregularities headaches nausea breast tenderness mood changes acne increased hair growth and changes in liver protein production among others. Other side effects of progestogens may include an increased risk of breast cancer cardiovascular disease and blood clots. At high doses progestogens can cause low sex hormone levels and associated side effects like sexual dysfunction and an increased risk of bone fractures.Progestogens are agonists of the progesterone receptors (PRs) and produce progestogenic or progestational effects. They have important effects in the female reproductive system (uterus cervix and vagina) the breasts and the brain. In addition many progestogens also have other hormonal activities such as androgenic antiandrogenic estrogenic glucocorticoid or antimineralocorticoid activity. They also have antigonadotropic effects and at high doses can strongly suppress sex hormone production. Progestogens mediate their contraceptive effects both by inhibiting ovulation and by thickening cervical mucus thereby preventing fertilization. They have functional antiestrogenic effects in certain tissues like the endometrium and this underlies their use in menopausal hormone therapy.Progesterone was first introduced for medical use in 1934 and the first progestin ethisterone was introduced for medical use in 1939. More potent progestins such as norethisterone were developed and started to be used in birth control in the 1950s. Around 60\u00a0progestins have been marketed for clinical use in humans or use in veterinary medicine. These progestins can be grouped into different classes and generations. Progestogens are available widely throughout the world and are used in all forms of hormonal birth control and in most menopausal hormone therapy regimens."

It is relatively common and occurs in 1 in 1000 females but is rarely diagnosed; fewer than 10% of those with the condition know they have it.Those who have symptoms can have learning disabilities mild dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism (wide-spaced eyes) and clinodactyly (incurved little fingers) early menopause and increased height. As the symptoms of trisomy X are often not serious enough to prompt a karyotype test many cases of trisomy X are diagnosed before birth via prenatal screening tests such as amniocentesis. Research on females with the disorder finds that cases which were diagnosed postnatally having been referred for testing because of obvious symptoms are generally more severe than those diagnosed prenatally. Most females with trisomy X live normal lives although their socioeconomic status is reduced compared to the general population.Trisomy X occurs via a process called nondisjunction in which normal cell division is interrupted and produces gametes with too many or too few chromosomes. Nondisjunction is a random occurrence and most girls and women with trisomy X have no family histories of chromosome aneuploidy. Advanced maternal age is mildly associated with trisomy X. Women with trisomy X can have children of their own who in most cases do not have an increased risk of chromosome disorders; women with mosaic trisomy X who have a mix of 46XX (the typical female karyotype) and 47XXX cells may have an increased risk of chromosomally abnormal children.First reported in 1959 by the geneticist Patricia Jacobs the early understanding of trisomy X was that of a debilitating disability observed in institutionalized women. Beginning in the 1960s studies of people with sex chromosome aneuploidies from birth to adulthood found that they are often only mildly affected fitting in with the general population and that many never needed the attention of clinicians because of the condition."

In young children or elderly adults with cognitive impairment the source of bleeding may not be obvious and may be from the urinary tract (hematuria) or the rectum rather than the vagina although most adult women can identify the site of bleeding. When vaginal bleeding occurs in prepubertal children or in postmenopausal women it always needs medical attention.Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be normal especially in early pregnancy. However bleeding may also indicate a pregnancy complication that needs to be medically addressed. During pregnancy bleeding is usually but not always related to the pregnancy itself.The treatment of vaginal bleeding is dependent on the specific cause which can often be determined through a thorough history physical and medical testing."

        "article": "Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei also known as acne agminata  is a disease with a similar appearance to acne vulgaris. The cause of LMDF is unknown. LMDF usually occurs on the face but extrafacial presentations have been reported. Mycobacterium tuberculosis or its products may cause a caseous necrosis and thus maybe one of several possible causes. Some authors view LMDF as a variant of granulomatous rosacea or a presentation related to Demodex folliculitis. Others suggest it as a new independent entity and proposed a new term: Facial Idiopathic GranUlomas with Regressive Evolution. Misago et al. postulated LMDF as a common adult form childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis as a rare childhood form and perioral dermatitis as a peculiar form exacerbated by topical corticosteroids. There are no randomized controlled trials available for the treatment of LMDF. The usual first-line therapy is oral tetracyclines with variable success rates. Dapsone low-dose prednisolone clofazimine and isotretinoin have all been tried in some cases. The 1450-nm diode laser has been shown to improve LMDF."

It started in 1866 on health principles advocated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and from 1876 to 1943 was managed by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.The \"San\" as it was called flourished under Dr. Kellogg's direction and became one of the \"premier wellness destinations\" in the United States. After a devastating fire in 1902 the Sanitarium was not only rebuilt but also enlarged. At its zenith the sprawling health and wellness complex of more than 30 buildings situated on 30 acres accommodated near thirteen hundred guests. It housed a hospital with research facilities and a nursing school as well as the Sanitarium Food Company among others. Following the disfellowshipping of Dr. Kellogg in 1907 the physician stated that he and his employees were \"independents\" who \"did not belong to any church\" and that the Sanitarium promoted his theory of \"biologic living\" based on Adventist principles. In 1928 a distinct 14-story addition to the main building the \"Towers\" was constructed.The Great Depression forced the institution to constrict and sell assets to serve its debt. In 1942 the signature main building was purchased by the U.S. Army and converted into the Percy Jones Army Hospital and the sanatorium moved to the former Phelps Sanitarium building. The hospital was disbanded in the 1950s and the facility was managed by the General Services Administration. In 2003 it was re-dedicated as the Hart\u2013Dole\u2013Inouye Federal Center.In 1957 the floundering wellness institution was taken over by the Seventh-day Adventist Church which operated it under a different name until 1993 when it was sold."

The therapy uses a blue light (420\u2013470\u00a0nm) that converts bilirubin into an (EZ)-isomer that can be excreted in the urine and feces. Soft goggles are put on the child to reduce eye damage from the high intensity light. The baby is kept naked or only wearing a diaper and is turned over frequently to expose more of the skin.Conventional bili lights shine from above the baby. A biliblanket consists of a fiber-optic blanket designed to transfer the light from a lamp unit all around the baby's body and is more commonly used at home."

In other cases it results from red blood cell breakdown liver disease infection hypothyroidism or metabolic disorders (pathologic). A bilirubin level more than 34\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (2\u00a0mg/dL) may be visible. Concerns in otherwise healthy babies occur when levels are greater than 308\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (18\u00a0mg/dL) jaundice is noticed in the first day of life there is a rapid rise in levels jaundice lasts more than two weeks or the baby appears unwell. In those with concerning findings further investigations to determine the underlying cause are recommended.The need for treatment depends on bilirubin levels the age of the child and the underlying cause. Treatments may include more frequent feeding phototherapy or exchange transfusions. In those who are born early more aggressive treatment tends to be required. Physiologic jaundice generally lasts less than seven days. The condition affects over half of babies in the first week of life. Of babies that are born early about 80% are affected. Globally over 100000 late-preterm and term babies die each year as a result of jaundice."

It consists of irradiation of the skin with the UVA ultraviolet light from a fluorescent bulb or LED lamps.Tanning beds are used both in dermatology practices for the treatment of cosmetic skin conditions (such as psoriasis acne eczema and vitiligo) and in indoor tanning salons for cosmetic tanning.Typical treatment regimens involve short exposure to UVB rays 3 to 5 times a week at a hospital or clinic and repeated sessions may be required before results are noticeable. Almost all of the conditions that respond to UVB light are chronic problems so continuous treatment is required to keep those problems in check. Home UVB systems are common solutions for those whose conditions respond to treatment. Home systems permit patients to treat themselves every other day (the ideal treatment regimen for most) without the frequent costly trips to the office/clinic and back mainly when the area is small and the price of the lamp is low."

Biological pigments include plant pigments and flower pigments. Many biological structures such as skin eyes feathers fur and hair contain pigments such as melanin in specialized cells called chromatophores. In some species pigments accrue over very long periods during an individual's lifespan.Pigment color differs from structural color in that it is the same for all viewing angles whereas structural color is the result of selective reflection or iridescence usually because of multilayer structures. For example butterfly wings typically contain structural color although many butterflies have cells that contain pigment as well."

The appearance of blue green and hazel eyes results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma a phenomenon similar to Rayleigh scattering which accounts for the blue sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are present in the human iris or vitreous humour. This is an example of structural color which depends on the lighting conditions especially for lighter-colored eyes.The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments such as pteridines purines and carotenoids. Humans and other animals have many phenotypic variations in eye color.The genetics and inheritance of eye color in humans is complicated. As of 2010 as many as 16 genes have been associated with eye color inheritance. Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2. The earlier belief that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect. The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur. However OCA2 gene polymorphism close to proximal 5' regulatory region explains most human eye-color variation."

        "article": "Linea nigra denoted by its Latin translation \"black line\" colloquially known as the pregnancy line manifests as a linear area of heightened pigmentation frequently observed on the abdominal region during pregnancy. Typically spanning approximately one centimeter (0.4 in) in width this brownish streak extends vertically along the midline of the abdomen spanning from the pubis to the umbilicus. Variably it may traverse from the pubis to the upper abdominal region.For pregnant women the emergence of linea nigra is attributed to an increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone by the placenta. This physiological phenomenon is concomitant with the occurrence of melasma and darkened nipples. Individuals with lighter skin pigmentation tend to exhibit this phenomenon less frequently in comparison to those possessing darker pigmentation. It is typical for the linea nigra to fade and dissipate within several months following childbirth.Although predominantly associated with pregnancy it can manifest in both males and females of all ages. Beyond the gestational context its prevalence is found to be uniformly elevated in both sexes during the ages of 11 to 15. This is potentially attributable to hormonal fluctuations characteristic of puberty. After age 15 the prevalence of the linea nigra in both males and females declines. Particularly in postpubescent females it often serves as an indicator of elevated benign estrogens. The prevalence of this phenomenon in both genders drops below 10% following the age of 30. Furthermore its appearance may ensue after rapid weight gain over a short interval. It could also rarely serve as an indicator of underlying hormonal imbalances genetic disorders malignancy inflammation or even fungal infections."

Defects include malformations disruptions deformations and dysplasia that may cause stunted growth delayed mental development or other congenital disorders that lack structural malformations.

The types of dermatophytosis are typically named for area of the body that they affect. Multiple areas can be affected at a given time.About 40 types of fungus can cause dermatophytosis. They are typically of the Trichophyton Microsporum or Epidermophyton type. Risk factors include using public showers contact sports such as wrestling excessive sweating contact with animals obesity and poor immune function. Ringworm can spread from other animals or between people. Diagnosis is often based on the appearance and symptoms. It may be confirmed by either culturing or looking at a skin scraping under a microscope.Prevention is by keeping the skin dry not walking barefoot in public and not sharing personal items. Treatment is typically with antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or miconazole. If the scalp is involved antifungals by mouth such as fluconazole may be needed.Dermatophytosis has spread globally and up to 20% of the world's population may be infected by it at any given time.

        "article": "Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause infections and certain diseases in animals including humans. The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses. The family name is derived from the Greek word \u1f15\u03c1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (herpein 'to creep') referring to spreading cutaneous lesions usually involving blisters seen in flares of herpes simplex 1 herpes simplex 2 and herpes zoster (shingles). In 1971 the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) established Herpesvirus as a genus with 23 viruses among four groups. As of 2020 115 species are recognized all but one of which are in one of the three subfamilies. Herpesviruses can cause both latent and lytic infections. Nine herpesvirus types are known to primarily infect humans at least five of which  are extremely widespread among most human populations and which cause common diseases: herpes simplex 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2 also known as HHV-1 and HHV-2; both of which can cause orolabial and genital herpes) varicella zoster (or HHV-3; the cause of chickenpox and shingles) Epstein\u2013Barr (EBV or HHV-4; implicated in several diseases including mononucleosis and some cancers) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV-5). More than 90% of adults have been infected with at least one of these and a latent form of the virus remains in almost all humans who have been infected. Other human herpesviruses are human herpesvirus 6A and 6B (HHV-6A and HHV-6B) human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV also known as HHV-8). HHV here stands for \"Human Herpesvirus\". In total  more than 130 herpesviruses are known some of them from mammals birds fish reptiles amphibians and molluscs. Among the animal herpesviruses are pseudorabies virus causing Aujeszky's disease in pigs and bovine herpesvirus 1 causing bovine infectious rhinotracheitis and pustular vulvovaginitis."

IPL is increasingly used in optometry and ophthalmology as well to treat evaporative dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction.The technology uses a high-powered hand-held computer-controlled flashgun to deliver an intense visible broad-spectrum pulse of light generally in the visible spectral range of 400 to 1200\u00a0nm.  Various cutoff filters are commonly used to selectively filter out shorter wavelengths especially potentially damaging ultraviolet light. The resulting light has a spectral range that targets specific structures and chromophores (e.g. melanin in hair or oxyhemoglobin in blood vessels) that are heated to destruction and reabsorbed by the body.  IPL shares some similarities with laser treatments in that they both use light to heat and destroy their targets. But unlike lasers that use a single wavelength (color) of light which typically matches only one chromophore and hence only treats one condition IPL uses a broad spectrum that when used with interchangeable filters allowing it to be used against several conditions.  This can be achieved when the IPL technician selects the appropriate filter that matches a specific chromophore."

PVA causes areas of affected skin to appear speckled red and inflamed yellowish and/or brown gray or grayish-black with scaling and a thinness that may be described as \"cigarette paper\". On the surface of the skin these areas may range in size from small patches to plaques (larger raised areas) to neoplasms (spreading tumor-like growths on the skin).Mycosis fungoides a type of skin lymphoma may be a cause of PVA. The condition may also be caused by associated with or accompany any of the following conditions or disorders: other skin lymphomas dermatomyositis lupus erythematosus Rothmund\u2013Thomson syndrome Kindler syndrome dyskeratosis congenita and chronic radiodermatitis. Rare causes include arsenic ingestion and the condition can also be idiopathic.PVA may be considered a rare variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma a non-Hodgkin's form of lymphoma affecting the skin. It may also be included among a number of similar conditions that are considered as precursors to mycosis fungoides.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria can be characterized by angioedema excruciatingly itchy recurrent hives or both. Chronic urticaria patients were found to have a higher prevalence of various autoimmune diseases. Many patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria report that certain triggers such as stress infections specific foods or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use aggravate their condition.Wheals and angioedema appear to be caused by the degranulation of skin mast cells in CSU. These cells secrete proteases histamine and cytokines as well as platelet-activating factors and other arachidonic acid metabolites.  Several theories exist regarding the pathophysiology of chronic urticaria none of which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Studies have been conducted to investigate the validity of serologic testing in order to establish an autoimmune basis for disease as well as the autoimmune theory of illness. Other hypotheses include additional serologic factors tissue mast cell abnormalities and basophils.The standard workup for CSU differs in different parts of the world. However most doctors\u00a0agree on the importance of having a detailed history. The main goal is to identify any urticaria-inducing factors because eliminating them is the most straightforward course of treatment. Basic laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and possibly a complete blood count (CBC) with differential are critical for detecting signs of systemic inflammation and ruling out autoinflammatory conditions as well as urticarial vasculitis with systemic involvement.For the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria a two-pronged strategy has been proposed. The underlying cause(s) and/or eliciting trigger(s) must first be identified and eliminated. The second approach is pharmacotherapy which aims to alleviate symptoms. Although eliminating the source of the problem is the ideal solution it does not appear to be feasible in many cases. A therapeutic approach should be implemented in three steps according to current guidelines: (1) taking a second-generation antihistamine once daily; (2) increasing the second-generation antihistamine's daily dose up to four times; and (3) pursuing off-label therapy with cyclosporine A or montelukast or add-on therapy with omalizumab which is an approved treatment option for CSU."

        "article": "Ketotifen is an antihistamine medication and a mast cell stabilizer used to treat allergic conditions such as conjunctivitis asthma and urticaria (hives). Ketotifen is available in ophthalmic (eye drops or drug-eluting contact lenses) and oral (tablets or syrup) forms: the ophthalmic form relieves eye itchiness and irritation associated with seasonal allergies while the oral form helps prevent systemic conditions such as asthma attacks and allergic reactions. In addition to treating allergies ketotifen has shown efficacy in managing systemic mast cell diseases such as mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) which involve abnormal accumulation or activation of mast cells throughout the body. Ketotifen is also used for other allergic-type conditions like atopic dermatitis (eczema) and food allergies.Ketotifen acts by blocking the H1 histamine receptors which are found on various cells in the body such as smooth muscle endothelium and nerve cells so that ketotifen prevents the binding of histamine to these receptors and thus reduces the symptoms of histamine-mediated reactions such as itching sneezing wheezing and swelling. Ketotifen also prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from immune cells called mast cells; this action helps reduce symptoms of conditions (including allergic conditions) by blocking the activation of these cells. In addition to its antihistaminic activity ketotifen also functions as a leukotriene antagonist which blocks inflammation-causing chemicals known as leukotrienes; it also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that regulates blood vessel dilation.While well-tolerated ketotifen can have side effects including drowsiness weight gain dry mouth irritability increased nosebleeds when taken orally and temporary burning or stinging sensations in the eyes when used in ophtalmic form. Ketotifen has contraindications for individuals with certain medical conditions such as acute porphyrias or epilepsy. Controversies surrounding ketotifen include its classification as a first-generation or second-generation antihistamine due to varying criteria of classification.Research on ketotifen continues to explore its impact on appetite regulation and effectiveness against specific medical conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. Despite inconclusive evidence regarding its efficacy in asthma treatment compared to other medications like montelukast long-term administration of oral ketotifen has shown positive outcomes in reducing corticosteroid use while improving clinical symptoms related to asthma management."

        "article": "Postpartum psychosis (PPP) also known as puerperal psychosis or peripartum psychosis involves the abrupt onset of psychotic symptoms shortly following childbirth typically within two weeks of delivery but less than 4 weeks postpartum. PPP is a condition currently represented under \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Volume V (DSM-V). Symptoms may include delusions hallucinations disorganized speech (e.g. incoherent speech) and/or abnormal motor behavior (e.g. catatonia). Other symptoms frequently associated with PPP include confusion disorganized thought severe difficulty sleeping variations of mood disorders (including depression agitation mania or a combination of the above) as well as cognitive features such as consciousness that comes and goes (waxing and waning) or disorientation.The cause of PPP is currently unknown though growing evidence for the broad category of postpartum psychiatric disorders (e.g. postpartum depression) suggests hormonal and immune changes as potential factors contributing to their onset as well as genetics and circadian rhythm disruption. There is no agreement in the evidence about risk factors though a number of studies have suggested that sleep loss first pregnancies (primiparity) and previous episodes of PPP may play a role. More recent reviews have added to growing evidence that prior psychiatric diagnoses especially bipolar disorder in the individual or her family may raise the risk of a new-onset psychosis triggered by childbirth. There are currently no screening or assessment tools available to diagnose PPP; a diagnosis must be made by the attending physician based on the patient's presenting symptoms guided by diagnostic criteria in the DSM-V (see Diagnosis).While PPP is seen only in 1 to 2 of every 1000 childbirths the rapid development of psychotic symptoms particularly those that include delusions of misidentification or paranoia raises concerns for the safety of the patient and the infant; thus PPP is considered a psychiatric emergency usually requiring urgent hospitalization. Treatment may include medications such as benzodiazepines lithium and antipsychotics as well as procedures such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In some cases where pregnant women have a known history of bipolar disorder or previous episodes of PPP prophylactic use of medication (especially lithium) either throughout or immediately after delivery has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of psychotic or bipolar episodes in the postpartum period.PPP is not an independently recognized diagnosis in the DSM-V; instead the specifier \"with peripartum onset\" is used for both \"Brief psychotic disorder\" and \"Unspecified bipolar and related disorders.\" Recent literature suggests that more frequently this syndrome occurs in the context of known or new-onset bipolar illness (see Postpartum Bipolar Disorder). Given the variety of symptoms associated with PPP a thorough consideration of other psychiatric and non-psychiatric (or organic) causes must be ruled out through a combination of diagnostic labwork and imaging as well as clinical presentation - a non-exhaustive sample of these other causes is examined below (see Organic postpartum psychoses and Other non-organic postpartum psychoses)."

Sunburn is an inflammatory response in the tissue triggered by direct DNA damage by UV radiation. When the cells' DNA is overly damaged by UV radiation type I cell-death is triggered and the tissue is replaced.Sun protective measures like sunscreen and sun protective clothing are widely accepted to prevent sunburn and some types of skin cancer. Special populations including children are especially susceptible to sunburn and protective measures should be used to prevent damage."

It is classified as a type of physical urticaria. The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on the wavelength of the radiation that causes the breakout; another classification system is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout.The agent in the human body responsible for the reaction to radiation known as the photoallergen has not yet been identified. The disease itself can be difficult  to diagnose  properly because it is so similar to other dermatological disorders such as  polymorphous light eruption or PLE. The most helpful test is a diagnostic phototest a specialized test which confirms the presence of an abnormal sunburn reaction. Once recognized treatment of the disease commonly involves the administration of antihistamines and desensitization treatments such as phototherapy. In more extreme cases the use of immunosuppressive drugs and even plasmapheresis may be considered.The initial discovery of the disease is credited to P. Merklen in 1904 but it did not have a name until the suggestion of \"solar urticaria\" was given by William Waddell Duke in 1923. However their research contributed to the study of this uncommon disease. More than  one hundred cases have been reported in the past century."

        "article": "Nickel is a chemical element; it has symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts usually in ultramafic rocks and in the interiors of larger nickel\u2013iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron\u2013nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.Use of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel\u2013iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500\u00a0BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral in the cobalt mines of Los H\u00e4lsingland Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals were green like copper ores and were known as kupfernickel \u2013 Nickel's copper \u2013 because they produced no copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite which is often 1\u20132% nickel. Other important nickel ore minerals include pentlandite and a mix of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin) New Caledonia in the Pacific and Norilsk Russia.Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating. About 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys 9% for plating 7% for alloy steels 3% in foundries and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses such as a catalyst for hydrogenation cathodes for rechargeable batteries pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site."

It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century a span of over 2000 years. In Europe the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 19th century. The practice has now been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions. In the beginning of the 19th century studies had begun to show the harmful effects of bloodletting.Today the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion. Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis polycythemia vera porphyria cutanea tarda etc. to reduce the number of red blood cells.

It is composed of four pyrrole rings with 2 vinyl and 2 propionic acid side chains.  Heme is biosynthesized in both the bone marrow and the liver.Heme plays a critical role in multiple different redox reactions in mammals due to its ability to carry the oxygen moiety.  Reactions include oxidative metabolism (cytochrome c oxidase succinate dehydrogenase) xenobiotic detoxification via cytochrome P450 pathways (including metabolism of some drugs) gas sensing (guanyl cyclases nitric oxide synthase) and microRNA processing (DGCR8).Heme is a coordination complex \"consisting of an iron ion coordinated to a tetrapyrrole acting as a tetradentate ligand and to one or two axial ligands\". The definition is loose and many depictions omit the axial ligands. Among the metalloporphyrins deployed by metalloproteins as prosthetic groups heme is one of the most widely used and defines a family of proteins known as hemoproteins. Hemes are most commonly recognized as components of hemoglobin the red pigment in blood but are also found in a number of other biologically important hemoproteins such as myoglobin cytochromes catalases heme peroxidase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The word haem is derived from Greek \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 haima 'blood'."

Unlike acute intermittent porphyria individuals with HCP can present with cutaneous findings similar to those found in porphyria cutanea tarda in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias. Like other porphyrias attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs environmental stressors or diet changes.  Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect.  Overall porphyrias are rare diseases.

Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain chest pain vomiting confusion constipation fever high blood pressure and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis low blood sodium levels and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol smoking hormonal changes fasting stress or certain medications. If the skin is affected blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure.Most types of porphyria are inherited from one or both of a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or X-linked dominant manner. One type porphyria cutanea tarda may also be due to hemochromatosis (increased iron in the liver) hepatitis C alcohol or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically made by blood urine and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation. Hepatic porphyrias are those in which the enzyme deficiency occurs in the liver. Hepatic porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) variegate porphyria (VP) aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD) hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and porphyria cutanea tarda Treatment depends on the type of porphyria and the person's symptoms. Treatment of porphyria of the skin generally involves the avoidance of sunlight while treatment for acute porphyria may involve giving intravenous heme or a glucose solution. Rarely a liver transplant may be carried out.The precise prevalence of porphyria is unclear but it is estimated to affect between 1 and 100 per 50000 people. Rates are different around the world. Porphyria cutanea tarda is believed to be the most common type. The disease was described as early as 370 BC by Hippocrates. The underlying mechanism was first described by German physiologist and chemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871. The name porphyria is from the Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 porphyra meaning \"purple\" a reference to the color of the urine that may be present during an attack."

The disorder results from low levels of the enzyme responsible for the fifth step in heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs. It is a component of hemoglobin the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood.Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria has been described as a homozygous form of porphyria cutanea tarda although it can also be caused if two different mutations occur at the same locus."

The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body. There are multiple forms of alternating hemiplegia Weber's syndrome middle alternating hemiplegia and inferior alternating hemiplegia.  This type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons.  The muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis.  With a lesion in the brainstem this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem.  The cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion.  Cranial nerves III (Oculomotor) VI (Abducens) and XII (Hypoglossal) are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord.  Damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation (aside from the trochlear nerve) before innervating their target muscles. The paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days many times the episodes will resolve after sleep. Some common symptoms of alternating hemiplegia are mental impairment gait and balance difficulties excessive sweating and changes in body temperature."

Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally only one side of the brain is affected. This type is the most common. Type 2 involvement includes a facial angioma (port wine stain) with a possibility of glaucoma developing. There is no evidence of brain involvement. Symptoms can show at any time beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial angioma. The symptoms can include glaucoma cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches. More research is needed on this type of Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome. Type 3 has leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively. The facial angioma is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs.

Worldwide pregnancy complications are the leading cause of death for women and girls 15 to 19 years old. The definition of teenage pregnancy includes those who are legally considered adults in their country. The WHO defines adolescence as the period between the ages of 10 and 19 years. Pregnancy can occur with sexual intercourse after the start of ovulation which can happen before the first menstrual period (menarche). In healthy well-nourished girls the first period usually takes place between the ages of 12 and 13.Pregnant teenagers face many of the same pregnancy-related issues as older women. Teenagers are more likely to experience pregnancy complications or maternal death than women aged 20 or older. There are additional concerns for those under the age of 15 as they are less likely to be physically developed to sustain a healthy pregnancy or to give birth. For girls aged 15\u201319 risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age. Risks of low birth weight premature labor anemia and pre-eclampsia are not connected to biological age by the time a girl is 16 as they are not observed in births to older teens after controlling for other risk factors such as access to high-quality prenatal care.Teenage pregnancies are related to social issues including lower educational levels and poverty. Teenage pregnancy in developed countries is usually outside of marriage and is often associated with a social stigma. Teenage pregnancy in developing countries often occurs within marriage and approximately half are planned. However in these societies early pregnancy may combine with malnutrition and poor health care to cause medical problems. When used in combination educational interventions and access to birth control can reduce unintended teenage pregnancies.In 2023 about 41 females per 1000 gave birth between the ages of 15 and 19 as compared with roughly 65 births per 1000 in 2000. From 2015 to 2021 an estimated 14 percent of adolescent girls and young women globally reported giving birth before age 18. The adolescent birth rate is higher in lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC) as compared to higher- income countries. In the developing world approximately 2.5 million females aged 15 to 19 years old have children each year. Another 3.9 million have abortions. It is more common in rural than urban areas.In 2021 13.3 million babies or about 10 percent of the total worldwide were born to mothers under 20 years old."

It is caused by the ingestion of shiitake mushrooms and was first described in 1977 by Nakamura. Although it is rarely seen outside China and Japan due to a lower incidence of shiitake consumption outside these regions there is a well-established association between flagellate dermatitis and shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) ingestion. Bleomycin ingestion may also cause similar findings. On physical exam one key difference between the two is that post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation changes are usually seen with bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis and are not typically present with shiitake mushroom induced flagellate dermatitis. The median time of onset from ingestion of shiitake mushrooms is typically 24 hours ranging from 12 hours to 5 days. Most patients completely recover by 3 weeks with or without treatment. Although the pathogenesis of shiitake induced flagellate dermatitis is not clear the theory most argued for is a toxic reaction to lentinan a polysaccharide isolated from shiitake mushrooms. However Type I and Type IV allergic hypersensitivities have also been supported by the 24-hour median time of onset clearance in 3\u201321 days severe pruritus benefit of steroids and antihistamines and lack of grouped outbreaks in people exposed to shared meals containing shiitake mushrooms.

Recommended levels in water are less than 10\u201350\u00a0\u03bcg/L (10\u201350 parts per billion). Other routes of exposure include toxic waste sites and pseudo-medicine. Most cases of poisoning are accidental. Arsenic acts by changing the functioning of around 200 enzymes. Diagnosis is by testing the urine blood or hair.Prevention is by using water that does not contain high levels of arsenic. This may be achieved by the use of special filters or using rainwater. There is not good evidence to support specific treatments for long-term poisoning. For acute poisonings treating dehydration is important. Dimercaptosuccinic acid or dimercaptopropane sulfonate may be used while dimercaprol (BAL) is not recommended. Hemodialysis may also be used.Through drinking water more than 200 million people globally are exposed to higher-than-safe levels of arsenic. The areas most affected are Bangladesh and West Bengal.

When a musculoskeletal injury occurs the body sends signals to our inflammatory cells macrophages which release IGF-1. IGF-1 is a hormone-insulin-like growth factor which initiates the termination of damaged tissue. In some cases this inflammatory response can be aggravated and cause increased swelling and edema which can actually prolong the recovery process. For decades it has been commonly used to accelerate recovery in athletes after exercise. Cryotherapy decreases the temperature of tissue surfaces to minimize hypoxic cell death edema accumulation and muscle spasms. Minimising each or all of these ultimately alleviates discomfort and inflammation. It can involve a range of treatments from the application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths (generally known as cold therapy) to the use of cold chambers. "

        "article": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules are involved in sequence-specific suppression of gene expression by double-stranded RNA through translational or transcriptional repression. Historically RNAi was known by other names including co-suppression post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and quelling. The detailed study of each of these seemingly different processes elucidated that the identity of these phenomena were all actually RNAi. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNAi in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi is now known as precise efficient stable and better than antisense therapy for gene suppression. Antisense RNA produced intracellularly by an expression vector may be developed and find utility as novel therapeutic agents.Two types of small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are central to components to the RNAi pathway. Once mRNA is degraded post-transcriptional silencing occurs as protein translation is prevented. Transcription can be inhibited via the pre-transcriptional silencing mechanism of RNAi through which an enzyme complex catalyzes DNA methylation at genomic positions complementary to complexed siRNA or miRNA. RNAi has an important role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences (e.g. viruses or transposons) and also influences development of organisms.The RNAi pathway is a naturally occurring process found in many eukaryotes and animal cells. It is initiated by the enzyme Dicer which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of approximately 21 to 23 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) the passenger (sense) strand and the guide (antisense) strand. The passenger strand is then cleaved by the protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2). The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC assembly then binds and degrades the target mRNA. Specifically this is accomplished when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a mRNA molecule and induces cleavage by Ago2 a catalytic component of the RISC. In some organisms this process spreads systemically despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.RNAi is a valuable research tool both in cell culture and in living organisms because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi may be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene  (and the subsequent proteins it codes for) in the cell which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool for food medicine and insecticides."

        "article": "Ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding but fewer than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp dull or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate fainting or shock. With very rare exceptions the fetus is unable to survive.Overall ectopic pregnancies annually affect less than 2% of pregnancies worldwide.Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include pelvic inflammatory disease often due to chlamydia infection; tobacco smoking; endometriosis; prior tubal surgery; a history of infertility; and the use of assisted reproductive technology. Those who have previously had an ectopic pregnancy are at much higher risk of having another one. Most ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the fallopian tube which are known as tubal pregnancies but implantation can also occur on the cervix ovaries caesarean scar or within the abdomen. Detection of ectopic pregnancy is typically by blood tests for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and ultrasound. This may require testing on more than one occasion. Other causes of similar symptoms include: miscarriage ovarian torsion and acute appendicitis.Prevention is by decreasing risk factors such as chlamydia infections through screening and treatment. While some ectopic pregnancies will miscarry without treatment the standard treatment for ectopic pregnancy is a procedure to either remove the embryo from the fallopian tube or to remove the fallopian tube all together. The use of the medication methotrexate works as well as surgery in some cases. Specifically it works well when the beta-HCG is low and the size of the ectopic is small. Surgery such as a salpingectomy is still typically recommended if the tube has ruptured there is a fetal heartbeat or the woman's vital signs are unstable. The surgery may be laparoscopic or through a larger incision known as a laparotomy. Maternal morbidity and mortality are reduced with treatment.The rate of ectopic pregnancy is about 11 to 20 per 1000 live births in developed countries though it may be as high as 4% among those using assisted reproductive technology. It is the most common cause of death among women during the first trimester at approximately 6-13% of the total. In the developed world outcomes have improved while in the developing world they often remain poor. The risk of death among those in the developed world is between 0.1 and 0.3 percent while in the developing world it is between one and three percent. The first known description of an ectopic pregnancy is by Al-Zahrawi in the 11th century. The word \"ectopic\" means \"out of place\"."

        "article": "Lung cancer also known as lung carcinoma is a malignant tumor that begins in the lung. Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment tumors spread throughout the lung damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize spreading to other parts of the body.Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing shortness of breath or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and the remaining 85% (the non-small-cell lung cancers or NSCLC) are adenocarcinomas squamous-cell carcinomas and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread.Treatment for early stage lung cancer includes surgery to remove the tumor sometimes followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Later stage cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy alongside drug treatments that target specific cancer subtypes. Even with treatment only around 20% of people survive five years on from their diagnosis. Survival rates are higher in those diagnosed at an earlier stage diagnosed at a younger age and in women compared to men.Most lung cancer cases are caused by tobacco smoking. The remainder are caused by exposure to hazardous substances like asbestos and radon gas or by genetic mutations that arise by chance. Consequently lung cancer prevention efforts encourage people to avoid hazardous chemicals and quit smoking. Quitting smoking both reduces one's chance of developing lung cancer and improves treatment outcomes in those already diagnosed with lung cancer.Lung cancer is the most diagnosed and deadliest cancer worldwide with 2.2 million cases in 2020 resulting in 1.8 million deaths. Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; the average age at diagnosis is 70 years and the average age at death 72. Incidence and outcomes vary widely across the world depending on patterns of tobacco use. Prior to the advent of cigarette smoking in the 20th century lung cancer was a rare disease. In the 1950s and 1960s increasing evidence linked lung cancer and tobacco use culminating in declarations by most large national health bodies discouraging tobacco use."

        "article": "Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas a glandular organ behind the stomach begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.The most common pancreatic adenocarcinoma accounts for about 90% of cases and the term \"pancreatic cancer\" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes. Several other types of cancer which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas can also arise from these cells.About 1\u20132% of cases of pancreatic cancer are neuroendocrine tumors which arise from the hormone-producing cells of the pancreas. These are generally less aggressive than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Signs and symptoms of the most-common form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin abdominal or back pain unexplained weight loss light-colored stools dark urine and loss of appetite. Usually no symptoms are seen in the disease's early stages and symptoms that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs before the age of 40 and more than half of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking obesity diabetes and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking and 5\u201310% are linked to inherited genes.Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography blood tests and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages from early (stage\u00a0I) to late (stage\u00a0IV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat; however the risk is greater for men especially at very high levels of red meat consumption. However this is in debate as a study performed by the International Journal of Cancer in 2013 did not find any statistically significant relationship between red meat consumption and pancreatic cancer finding instead no male connection and only finding positive association of red meat consumption with pancreatic cancer risk in women after restriction to microscopically confirmed cases. Smokers' risk of developing the disease decreases immediately upon quitting and almost returns to that of the rest of the population after 20\u00a0years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy palliative care or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of cancer globally with one of the lowest survival rates. In 2015 pancreatic cancers of all types resulted in 411600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth-most-common cause of death from cancer in the United Kingdom and the third most-common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis; after diagnosis 25% of people survive one year and 12% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five\u00a0years from diagnosis 65% of those diagnosed are living though survival considerably varies depending on the type of tumor."

The IES-R is a revised version of the older version the 15-item IES. The IES-R contains seven additional items related to the hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD which were not included in the original IES. Items correspond directly to 14 of the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Respondents are asked to identify a specific stressful life event and then indicate how much they were distressed or bothered during the past seven days by each \"difficulty\" listed. The scale shows good measurement invariance as a one factor scale with both latino and non-latino populations.Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (\"not at all\") to 4 (\"extremely\"). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion Avoidance and Hyperarousal subscales. The authors recommend using means instead of raw sums for each of these subscale scores to allow comparison with scores from the Symptom Checklist 90 - Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis 1994). In general the IES-R and IES are not used to diagnosis PTSD. However cut-off scores for a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD have been cited in the literature.An example question is: \"Any reminders brought back feelings about it.\" (Respondents rate their degree of distress during the past seven days.)"

The term miscarriage is sometimes used to refer to all forms of pregnancy loss and pregnancy with abortive outcomes before 20 weeks of gestation.Miscarriage before 6 weeks of gestation is defined by ESHRE as biochemical loss. Once ultrasound or histological evidence shows that a pregnancy has existed the term used is clinical miscarriage which can be \"early\" before 12 weeks and \"late\" between 12 and 21 weeks. Fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation is also known as a stillbirth. The most common symptom of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain. Sadness anxiety and guilt may occur afterwards. Tissue and clot-like material may leave the uterus and pass through and out of the vagina. Recurrent miscarriage (also referred to medically as Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion or RSA) may also be considered a form of infertility.Risk factors for miscarriage include being an older parent previous miscarriage exposure to tobacco smoke obesity diabetes thyroid problems and drug or alcohol use. About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve checking to see if the cervix is open or sealed testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and an ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding.Prevention is occasionally possible with good prenatal care. Avoiding drugs alcohol infectious diseases and radiation may decrease the risk of miscarriage. No specific treatment is usually needed during the first 7 to 14 days. Most miscarriages will be completed without additional interventions. Occasionally the medication misoprostol or a procedure such as vacuum aspiration is used to remove the remaining tissue. Women who have a blood type of rhesus negative (Rh negative) may require Rho(D) immune globulin. Pain medication may be beneficial. Emotional support may help with processing the loss.Miscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Among women who know they are pregnant the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20% while rates among all fertilisation is around 30% to 50%. In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while in those over the age of 40 the risk is about 45%. Risk begins to increase around the age of 30. About 5% of women have two miscarriages in a row. Some recommend not using the term \"abortion\" in discussions with those experiencing a miscarriage to decrease distress. In Britain the term \"miscarriage\" has replaced any use of the term \"spontaneous abortion\" for pregnancy loss and in response to complaints of insensitivity towards women who had suffered such loss. An additional benefit of this change is reducing confusion among medical laymen who may not realize that the term \"spontaneous abortion\" refers to a naturally occurring medical phenomenon and not the intentional termination of pregnancy."

        "article": "Mental disorders can be a consequence of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss. Even though women can develop long-term psychiatric symptoms after a miscarriage acknowledging the potential of mental illness is not usually considered. A mental illness can develop in women who have experienced one or more miscarriages after the event or even years later. Some data suggest that men and women can be affected up to 15 years after the loss. Though recognized as a public health problem studies investigating the mental health status of women following miscarriage are still lacking. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop in women who have experienced a miscarriage.  Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage include emotional pain expressions of emotion and low levels of social support. Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks intrusive thoughts dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.  Clinical depression also is associated with miscarriage. Past responses by clinicians have been to prescribe sedatives.Recurring miscarriage may increase the incidence of intrusive thoughts in women and their partners.Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One disorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This psychological trauma can develop as a response to early pregnancy loss. Anxiety can also develop as a result of a miscarriage. Women describe the medical treatment that they receive contributed their distress.Intrusive thoughts can develop after the loss. Panic disorder and obsessive thoughts may also develop as a response to a miscarriage. Men may experience pain and psychological effects but react by adopting \"compensatory behaviours\" such as increasing consumption of alcohol. Because men can consider their role to be supportive they may not have their loss recognized."

It was founded by Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra (1816\u20131888) with the collaboration of his mentor Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky (1804\u20131878) and Carl Wedl (1815\u20131891) a pathologist with interest in skin diseases. Their pupils Isidor Neumann (1832\u20131906) Salomon Stricker (1834\u20131898) Heinrich Auspitz (1834\u20131885) Moritz Kaposi (1837\u20131902) all of the same generation; and Paul Gerson Unna (1850\u20131929) and Salomon Ehrmann (1854\u20131926) continued the tradition. Unna later became the father of German dermatopathology.Von Hebra first organized the dermatological service in the Vienna General Hospital. He was inspired by the movement towards a scientific dermatology already established in England by Robert Willan (1757\u20131812) and Thomas Bateman (1778\u20131821); and in France by Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert (1768\u20131837) Laurent-Th\u00e9odore Biett (1781\u20131840) Pierre Louis Alph\u00e9e Cazenave (1795\u20131877) and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Olive Rayer (1793\u20131867). The Vienna School adopted the approach of pathology (as influenced by the great Carl von Rokitansky a professor of von Hebra) and the doctrine of local causative agents. For example 2000 of the first 2500 dermatological patients treated by von Hebra had scabies.The members of the Vienna School discovered and described many new diseases and signs such as:Auspitz's signEczema herpeticumErythema exudativum multiformeHebra's diseaseHebra's prurigoImpetigo herpetiformisKaposi-Irgang syndromeKaposi's sarcomaLichen acuminatusLichen planus bullosusLichen ruber moniliformisLupus erythematosusPityriasis rubraTinea crurisUnna-Politzer naevusUnna's diseaseUnna-Thost syndromeXeroderma pigmentosa"

An anal fistula can be described as a narrow tunnel with its internal opening in the anal canal and its external opening in the skin near the anus. Anal fistulae commonly occur in people with a history of anal abscesses. They can form when anal abscesses do not heal properly.Anal fistulae originate from the anal glands which are located between the internal and external anal sphincter and drain into the anal canal. If the outlet of these glands becomes blocked an abscess can form which can eventually extend to the skin surface. The tract formed by this process is a fistula.Abscesses can recur if the fistula seals over allowing the accumulation of pus. It can then extend to the surface again \u2013 repeating the process.Anal fistulae per se do not generally harm but can be very painful and can be irritating because of the drainage of pus (it is also possible for formed stools to be passed through the fistula). Additionally recurrent abscesses may lead to significant short term morbidity from pain and importantly create a starting point for systemic infection.Treatment in the form of surgery is considered essential to allow drainage and prevent infection. Repair of the fistula itself is considered an elective procedure which many patients opt for due to the discomfort and inconvenience associated with an actively draining fistula."

        "article": "Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain nausea vomiting and decreased appetite. However approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix. This blockage typically results from a faecolith a calcified \"stone\" made of feces. Other factors such as inflamed lymphoid tissue from a viral infection intestinal parasites gallstone or tumors may also lead to this blockage. When the appendix becomes blocked it experiences increased pressure reduced blood flow and bacterial growth resulting in inflammation. This combination of factors causes tissue injury and ultimately tissue death. If this process is left untreated it can lead to the appendix rupturing which releases bacteria into the abdominal cavity potentially leading to severe complications.The diagnosis of appendicitis is largely based on the person's signs and symptoms. In cases where the diagnosis is unclear close observation medical imaging and laboratory tests can be helpful. The two most commonly used imaging tests for diagnosing appendicitis are ultrasound and computed tomography (CT scan). CT scan is more accurate than ultrasound in detecting acute appendicitis. However ultrasound may be preferred as the first imaging test in children and pregnant women because of the risks associated with radiation exposure from CT scans. Although ultrasound may aid in diagnosis its main role in identifying important differentials such as ovarian pathology in females or mesenteric adenitis in children. The standard treatment for acute appendicitis involves the surgical removal of the inflamed appendix. This procedure can be performed either through an open incision in the abdomen (laparotomy) or using minimally invasive techniques with small incisions and cameras (laparoscopy). Surgery is essential to reduce the risk of complications or potential death associated with the rupture of the appendix. Antibiotics may be equally effective in certain cases of non-ruptured appendicitis. It is one of the most common and significant causes of sudden abdominal pain. In 2015 approximately 11.6 million cases of appendicitis were reported resulting in around 50100 deaths worldwide. In the United States appendicitis is one of the most common causes of sudden abdominal pain requiring surgery. Annually more than 300000 individuals in the United States undergo surgical removal of their appendix."

A morbilliform rash is a rose-red flat (macular) or slightly elevated (maculopapular) eruption showing circular or elliptical lesions varying in diameter from 1 to 3\u00a0mm with healthy-looking skin intervening.Patients with measles will have the rash but there are other syndromes and infections that will display the same symptom such as patients with Kawasaki disease meningococcal petechiae or Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome Dengue Roseola congenital syphilis rubella Echovirus 9 drug hypersensitivity reactions (in particular with certain classes of antiretroviral drugs such as abacavir and nevirapine and also the antiepileptic drug phenytoin) or other conditions may also have a morbilliform rash. It has also been mentioned as a possible manifestation of onset or recovery from COVID-19.One cause of morbilliform rash is an allergic reaction to transfused blood/blood components. In such a case the skin lesions would develop within a few hours (Approx. 4hours) of transfusion along with pruritus. The condition may even present with other symptoms such as conjunctival oedema oedema in the lips and tongue and even localised angioedema. On rare occasions the condition may even escalate to anaphylactic shock where pulmonary restrictions are seen. The associated cause for this is a reaction against an allergen that is seldom identified during testing. Transfusing products with anti-IgA antibodies to IgA-deficient patients has also been a suspected cause for such reactions. Management usually relates to the stoppage of transfusion for around 30minutes until given antihistamines take effect. Transfusion may even be continued after if no further progression is seen."

It is characterised by multiple cutaneous leiomyomas and in women uterine leiomyomas. It predisposes individuals to renal cell cancer an association denominated hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. It is also associated with increased risk of uterine leiomyosarcoma. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene which leads to an accumulation of fumarate. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant and screening can typically begin in childhood. "

        "article": "Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a malignant heterogeneous tumor originating from renal tubular epithelial cells of the kidney which comprises approximately 10-15% of all kidney neoplasms. Based on its morphological features PRCC can be classified into two main subtypes which are type 1 (basophilic) and type 2 (eosinophilic).As with other types of renal cell cancer most cases of PRCC are discovered incidentally without showing specific signs or symptoms of cancer. In advanced stages hematuria flank pain and abdominal mass are the three classic manifestation. While a complete list of the causes of PRCC remains unclear several risk factors were identified to affect PRCC development such as genetic mutations kidney-related disease environmental and lifestyle risk factors. For pathogenesis type 1 PRCC is mainly caused by MET gene mutation while type 2 PRCC is associated with several different genetic pathways. For diagnosis PRCC is detectable through computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which commonly present a small homogeneous hyposvascular tumor. Nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy is usually recommended for PRCC treatment often accompanied with several targeted molecular therapies to inhibit metastatic spread. PRCC patients are predominantly male with a mean age of 52\u201366 years. When compared to conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the prognosis of non-metastatic PRCC is more favorable whereas a relatively worse outcome was reported in patients with metastatic disease. Globally the incidence of PRCC ranges between 3500 to 5000 cases while it greatly varies depending on gender age and race/ethnicity."

It may or may not be accompanied by an infection of the hair follicle (folliculitis) or \"razor bumps\" (pseudofolliculitis barbae) which vary in size. While ingrown hair most commonly appears in areas where the skin is shaved or waxed (beard legs pubic region) it can appear anywhere.  Anything that causes the hair to be broken off unevenly with a sharp tip can cause ingrown hairs. Ingrown hairs are also caused because of lack of natural exfoliation in the skin."

It had been performed experimentally for about twenty years before becoming commercially available in 1995\u20131996. One of the first published articles describing laser hair removal was authored by the group at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1998. Laser hair removal is widely practiced in clinics and even in homes using devices designed and priced for consumer self-treatment. Many reviews of laser hair removal methods safety and efficacy have been published in the dermatology literature.R. Rox Anderson and Melanie Grossman discovered that it was possible to selectively target a specific chromophore with a laser to partially damage basal stem cells inside the hair follicles. This method proved to be successful and was first applied in 1996. In 1997 the United States Food and Drug Administration approved this tactic of hair removal. As this technology continued to be researched laser hair removal became more effective and efficient; thus it is now a common method in removing hair for long periods of time."

A man is called clean-shaven if he has had his beard entirely removed.Both men and women sometimes shave their chest hair abdominal hair leg hair underarm hair pubic hair or any other body hair. Head shaving is much more common among men. It is often associated with religious practice the armed forces and some competitive sports such as swimming running bodybuilding and extreme sports. Historically head shaving has also been used to humiliate punish for purification or to show submission to an authority. In more recent history head shaving has been used in fund-raising efforts particularly for cancer research organizations and charitable organizations which serve cancer patients. The shaving of head hair is also sometimes done by cancer patients when their treatment may result in hair loss."

        "article": "A straight razor is a razor with a blade that can fold into its handle. They are also called open razors and cut-throat razors. The predecessors of the modern straight razors include bronze razors with cutting edges and fixed handles produced by craftsmen from Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom (1569 \u2014 1081 BC). Solid gold and copper razors were also found in Ancient Egyptian tombs dating back to the 4th millennium BC.The first steel-edged cutthroat razors were manufactured in Sheffield in 1680. By the late 1680s early 1690s razors with silver-covered handles along with other Sheffield-made products known as \"Sheffield wares\" were being exported to ports in the Gulf of Finland approximately 1200 miles (1931\u00a0km) from Sheffield. From there these goods were probably sent to Finland and even Russia. By 1740 Benjamin Huntsman was making straight razors complete with decorated handles and hollow-ground blades made from cast steel using a process he invented. Huntsman's process was adopted by the French sometime later albeit reluctantly at first due to nationalist considerations. In England razor manufacturers were even more reluctant than the French to adopt Huntsman's steel-making process and only did so after they saw its success in France.After their introduction in 1680 straight razors became the principal method of manual shaving for more than two hundred years and remained in common use until the mid-20th century. Straight razor production eventually fell behind that of the safety razor which was introduced in the late 19th century and featured a disposable blade. Electric razors have also reduced the market share of the straight razors especially since the 1950s. A 1979 comparative study of straight and electric razors performed by Dutch researchers found that straight razors shave hair approximately 0.002 in. (0.05mm) shorter than electrics.Since 2012 production of straight razors has increased multifold. Straight razor sales are increasing globally and manufacturers have difficulty satisfying demand. Sales started increasing since the product was featured in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall and have remained high since. Straight razors are also perceived as a better value and a more sustainable and efficient product. Dovo in Germany reports that since a production low of less than 8000 units per year in 2006 the company sells 3000 units per month and has 110000 orders with production lead time of three years. The increased sales have also led to an increase in the number of associated trades and artisans such as bladesmiths leather craftsmen and potters.Forums and outlets provide products directions and advice to straight razor users. Straight razor manufacturers exist in Europe Asia and North America. Antique straight razors are also actively traded.Straight razors require considerable skill to hone and strop and require more care during shaving. Straight razor design and use  was once a major portion of the curriculum in barber colleges."

Although patients exhibiting these symptoms have been identified as early as 1914  this disorder had not been studied extensively until recently. The identification of the specific ACDC gene and mutations occurred in 2011. ACDC is caused by a mutation in the NT5E gene which prevents calcium-removing agents from functioning. Patients with this mutation experience chronic pain difficulty moving and increased risk of cardiovascular problems. In experiments at the molecular level treatment with adenosine or a phosphatase inhibitor reversed and prevented calcification suggesting they could be used as possible treatment methods. There is currently no cure for ACDC and patients have limited treatment options which focus primarily on removal of blood calcium and improving mobility."

It is vesiculopustular rash made up of 1\u20133\u00a0mm fluid-filled lesions that rupture leaving behind a collarette of scale and a brown macule. The lesions are fragile and with no surrounding erythema. This rash occurs only in the newborn stage usually appearing a few days after birth but pigmented macules are sometimes already present at birth. The rash usually fades over three to four weeks  but may linger for up to three months after birth. It can occur anywhere on the body including the palms and soles.The cause of TNPM is unknown. It has been suggested that TNPM is merely a variant of erythema toxicum neonatorum or a \"precocious\" form of erythema toxicum neonatorum. No treatment is needed except for parental reassurance."

It was first described in 1921 by German surgeon Alexander Tietze and was subsequently named after him. The condition is characterized by tenderness and painful swelling of the anterior (front) chest wall at the costochondral (rib to cartilage) sternocostal (cartilage to sternum) or sternoclavicular (clavicle to sternum) junctions. Tietze syndrome affects the true ribs and has a predilection for the 2nd and 3rd ribs commonly affecting only a single joint. In environments such as the emergency department an estimated 20-50% of non-cardiac chest pain is due to a musculoskeletal cause. Despite musculoskeletal conditions such as Tietze syndrome being a common reason for visits to the emergency room they are frequently misdiagnosed as angina pectoris pleurisy and other serious cardiopulmonary conditions due to similar presentation. Though Tietze syndrome can be misdiagnosed life-threatening conditions with similar symptoms such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) should be ruled out prior to diagnosis of other conditions.Tietze syndrome is often confused with costochondritis. Tietze syndrome is differentiated from costochondritis by swelling of the costal cartilages which does not appear in costochondritis. Additionally costochondritis affects the 2nd to 5th ribs while Tietze syndrome typically affects the 2nd or 3rd rib. "

Pathergy can also lead to ulcerations at the site of surgical incisions. Pathergy is seen with both Beh\u00e7et's disease and pyoderma gangrenosum.  A highly similar phenomenon known as the Koebner phenomenon occurs in autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus among others.Doctors looking toward a diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's disease may attempt to induce a pathergy reaction with a test known as a \"skin prick test\". The inflammation and ulceration that occurs as a result of pathergy in pyoderma gangrenosum often responds to systemic steroid therapy.The pathergy reaction is a unique feature of Beh\u00e7et's disease and according to the International Study Group for Behcet's Disease is among the major criteria required for the diagnosis. Different positive pathergy reaction rates in BD have been reported worldwide. When BD-positive groups are studied for pathergy reaction the pathergy-positive and pathergy-negative BD groups showed a similar male: female ratio age at disease onset and mean disease duration. They also exhibited similar HLA-B51 levels and a similar frequency of oral ulcerations in close family members. The mucocutaneous manifestations systemic disease expression and severity score were similar in patients with and without the pathergy reaction. The presence of a positive pathergy reaction is not associated with an increased risk for specific mucocutaneous or systemic manifestations of the disease and probably does not predict a more severe disease course.It is also important to note that while a positive pathergy reaction helps to confirm a specific Beh\u00e7et's disease diagnosis a negative reaction does not invalidate a BD diagnosis because the disease process has to be active at the time of the skin prick test to produce a pathergy reaction. Differences in positive/negative pathergy and severity of the reaction depend on disease activity ethnicity type of needle used for the prick test among other factors.Pathergy test is done both orally and cutaneous.Orally the lower lip is the site of testing. Appearance of any ulcer or papule indicates a positive pathergy reaction.Cutaneous sites are the flexor forearm."

Weight loss fever and anemia may also occur. Often symptoms come on slowly and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms typically occur intermittently with periods of no symptoms between flares. Complications may include abnormal dilation of the colon (megacolon) inflammation of the eye joints or liver and colon cancer.The cause of UC is unknown. Theories involve immune system dysfunction genetics changes in the normal gut bacteria and environmental factors. Rates tend to be higher in the developed world with some proposing this to be the result of less exposure to intestinal infections or to a Western diet and lifestyle. The removal of the appendix at an early age may be protective. Diagnosis is typically by colonoscopy with tissue biopsies.Dietary changes such as maintaining a high-calorie diet or lactose-free diet may improve symptoms. Several medications are used to treat symptoms and bring about and maintain remission including aminosalicylates such as mesalazine or sulfasalazine steroids immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and  biologic therapy. Removal of the colon by surgery may be necessary if the disease is severe does not respond to treatment or if complications such as colon cancer develop.

Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain. The very term \"acrocyanosis\" is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands feet or parts of the face is noted.The principal (primary) form of acrocyanosis is that of a benign cosmetic condition sometimes caused by a relatively benign neurohormonal disorder. Regardless of its cause the benign form typically does not require medical treatment. A medical emergency would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold particularly in children and patients with poor general health. However frostbite differs from acrocyanosis because pain (via thermal nociceptors) often accompanies the former condition while the latter is very rarely associated with pain. There are also a number of other conditions that affect hands feet and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud phenomenon pernio acrorygosis erythromelalgia and blue finger syndrome. The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases especially when these syndromes co-exist.Acrocyanosis may be a sign of a more serious medical problem such as connective tissue diseases and diseases associated with central cyanosis. Other causative conditions include infections toxicities antiphospholipid syndrome cryoglobulinemia neoplasms. In these cases the observed cutaneous changes are known as \"secondary acrocyanosis\".

        "article": "Adrenergic blocking agents are a class of drugs that exhibit its pharmacological action through inhibiting the action of the sympathetic nervous system in the body. The sympathetic nervous system(SNS) is an autonomic nervous system that we cannot control by will. It triggers a series of responses after the body releases chemicals named noradrenaline and epinephrine. These chemicals will act on adrenergic receptors with subtypes Alpha-1 Alpha-2 Beta-1 Beta-2 Beta-3 which ultimately allow the body to trigger a \"fight-or-flight\" response to handle external stress. These responses include vessel constriction in general vessels whereas there is vasodilation in vessels that supply skeletal muscles or in coronary vessels. Additionally the heart rate and contractile force increase when SNS is activated which may be harmful to cardiac function as it increases metabolic demand.Adrenergic blocking agents treat certain diseases through blocking the adrenergic receptor preventing it from being activated by noradrenaline and epinephrine. As a result it stops the body from producing the \"fight-or-flight\" responses."

It is also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of certain symptoms in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. It is unclear if it is effective for treating sexual dysfunction in females. It can be taken orally (swallowed by mouth) intravenously (injection into a vein) or through the sublingual route (dissolved under the tongue). Onset when taken orally is typically within twenty minutes and lasts for about two hours.Common side effects include headaches heartburn and flushed skin. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include vision problems hearing loss and prolonged erection (priapism) that can lead to damage to the penis. Sildenafil should not be taken by people on nitric oxide donors such as nitroglycerin (glycerin trinitrate) as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure.Sildenafil acts by blocking phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) an enzyme that promotes breakdown of cGMP which regulates blood flow in the penis. It requires sexual arousal to work and does not by itself cause or increase sexual arousal. It also results in dilation of the blood vessels in the lungs.Pfizer originally discovered the medication in 1989 while looking for a treatment for angina. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 1998. In 2021 it was the 157th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 3\u00a0million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication.

        "article": "Chronic Somogyi rebound is a contested explanation of phenomena of elevated blood sugars experienced by diabetics in the morning. Also called the Somogyi effect and posthypoglycemic hyperglycemia it is a rebounding high blood sugar that is a response to low blood sugar. When managing the blood glucose level with insulin injections this effect is counter-intuitive to people who experience high blood sugar in the morning as a result of an overabundance of insulin at night.This theoretical phenomenon was named after Michael Somogyi [suh MOE jee] a Hungarian-born professor of biochemistry at the Washington University and Jewish Hospital of St. Louis who prepared the first insulin treatment given to a child with diabetes in the US in October 1922. Somogyi showed that excessive insulin makes diabetes unstable and first published his findings in 1938.Compare with the dawn phenomenon which is a morning rise in blood sugar in response to waning insulin and a growth hormone surge (that further antagonizes insulin)."

It is used to treat major depressive disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder post-traumatic stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth).Common side effects include drowsiness dry mouth loss of appetite sweating trouble sleeping and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25 serotonin syndrome and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain.Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021 it was the 95th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 7\u00a0million prescriptions. In 2018 it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States. In 2012 the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3\u00a0billion for withholding data unlawfully promoting use in those under 18 and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329."

Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines opioids stimulants antiepileptics and antidepressants as well as the recreational misuse of drugs such as alcohol opioids and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used the greater the duration of use and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome also known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or \"PAWS\" is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern often resulting in relapse and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months years or depending on individual factors indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by benzodiazepines. To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes."

Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute cholecystitis. The pain lasts longer in cholecystitis than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment recurrent episodes of cholecystitis are common. Complications of acute cholecystitis include gallstone pancreatitis common bile duct stones or inflammation of the common bile duct.More than 90% of the time acute cholecystitis is caused from blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills pregnancy a family history of gallstones obesity diabetes liver disease or rapid weight loss. Occasionally acute cholecystitis occurs as a result of vasculitis or chemotherapy or during recovery from major trauma or burns. Cholecystitis is suspected based on symptoms and laboratory testing. Abdominal ultrasound is then typically used to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment is usually with laparoscopic gallbladder removal within 24 hours if possible. Taking pictures of the bile ducts during the surgery is recommended. The routine use of antibiotics is controversial. They are recommended if surgery cannot occur in a timely manner or if the case is complicated. Stones in the common bile duct can be removed before surgery by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or during surgery. Complications from surgery are rare. In people unable to have surgery gallbladder drainage may be tried.About 10\u201315% of adults in the developed world have gallstones. Women more commonly have stones than men and they occur more commonly after age 40. Certain ethnic groups are more often affected; for example 48% of American Indians have gallstones. Of all people with stones 1\u20134% have biliary colic each year. If untreated about 20% of people with biliary colic develop acute cholecystitis. Once the gallbladder is removed outcomes are generally good. Without treatment chronic cholecystitis may occur. The word is from Greek cholecyst- meaning \"gallbladder\" and -itis meaning \"inflammation\"."

        "article": "Cirrhosis also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis due to damage caused by liver disease. Damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. Over time scar tissue can replace normal functioning tissue leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis. The disease typically develops slowly over months or years. Early symptoms may include tiredness weakness loss of appetite unexplained weight loss nausea and vomiting and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. As the disease worsens symptoms may include itchiness swelling in the lower legs fluid build-up in the abdomen jaundice bruising easily and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin. The fluid build-up in the abdomen may develop into spontaneous infections. More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus stomach or intestines and liver cancer. Stages of cirrhosis include compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis.Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholic liver disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH\u00a0\u2013 the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) heroin abuse chronic hepatitis\u00a0B and chronic hepatitis\u00a0C. Heavy drinking over a number of years can cause alcoholic liver disease. Liver damage has also been attributed to heroin usage over an extended period of time as well. NASH has a number of causes including obesity high blood pressure abnormal levels of cholesterol type\u00a02 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupts bile duct function genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis and chronic heart failure with liver congestion.Diagnosis is based on blood tests medical imaging and liver biopsy.Hepatitis\u00a0B vaccine can prevent hepatitis\u00a0B and the development of cirrhosis but no vaccination against hepatitis\u00a0C is available. No specific treatment for cirrhosis is known but many of the underlying causes may be treated by a number of medications that may slow or prevent worsening of the condition.  Hepatitis\u00a0B and C may be treatable with antiviral medications. Avoiding alcohol is recommended in all cases. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with steroid medications. Ursodiol may be useful if the disease is due to blockage of the bile duct. Other medications may be useful for complications such as abdominal or leg swelling hepatic encephalopathy and dilated esophageal veins. If cirrhosis leads to liver failure a liver transplant may be an option.Cirrhosis affected about 2.8\u00a0million people and resulted in 1.3\u00a0million deaths in 2015. Of these deaths alcohol caused 348000 (27%) hepatitis\u00a0C caused 326000 (25%) and hepatitis\u00a0B caused 371000 (28%). In the United States more men die of cirrhosis than women. The first known description of the condition is by Hippocrates in the fifth century BCE. The term \"cirrhosis\" was derived in 1819 from the Greek word \"kirrhos\" which describes the yellowish color of a diseased liver."

The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to any disease caused by gallstones and choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of migrated gallstones within bile ducts.Most people with gallstones (about 80%) are asymptomatic. However when a gallstone obstructs the bile duct and causes acute cholestasis a reflexive smooth muscle spasm often occurs resulting in an intense cramp-like visceral pain in the right upper part of the abdomen known as a biliary colic (or \"gallbladder attack\"). This happens in 1\u20134% of those with gallstones each year. Complications from gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) obstructive jaundice and infection in bile ducts (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain that lasts longer than five hours fever yellowish skin vomiting dark urine and pale stools.Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills pregnancy a family history of gallstones obesity diabetes liver disease or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol bile salts and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones and those formed mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected using blood tests.The risk of gallstones may be decreased by maintaining a healthy weight with exercise and a healthy diet. If there are no symptoms treatment is usually not needed. In those who are having gallbladder attacks surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically recommended. This can be carried out either through several small incisions or through a single larger incision usually under general anesthesia. In rare cases when surgery is not possible medication can be used to dissolve the stones or lithotripsy can be used to break them down.In developed countries 10\u201315% of adults experience gallstones. Gallbladder and biliary-related diseases occurred in about 104 million people (1.6% of people) in 2013 and resulted in 106000 deaths. Gallstones are more common among women than men and occur more commonly after the age of 40. Gallstones occur more frequently among certain ethnic groups than others. For example 48% of Native Americans experience gallstones whereas gallstone rates in many parts of Africa are as low as 3%. Once the gallbladder is removed outcomes are generally positive."

In severe cases it is manifested as jaundice the yellowing of tissues like skin and the sclera when excess bilirubin deposits in them. The US records 52500 jaundice patients annually. By definition bilirubin concentration of greater than 3\u00a0mg/ml is considered hyperbilirubinemia following which jaundice progressively develops and becomes apparent when plasma levels reach 20\u00a0mg/ml. Rather than a disease itself hyperbilirubinemia is indicative of multifactorial underlying disorders that trace back to deviations from regular bilirubin metabolism. Diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia depends on physical examination urinalysis serum tests medical history and imaging to identify the cause. Genetic diseases alcohol pregnancy and hepatitis viruses affect the likelihood of hyperbilirubinemia. Causes of hyperbilirubinemia mainly arise from the liver. These include haemolytic anaemias enzymatic disorders liver damage and gallstones. Hyperbilirubinemia itself is often benign. Only in extreme cases does kernicterus a type of brain injury occur. Therapy for adult hyperbilirubinemia targets the underlying diseases but patients with jaundice often have poor outcomes."

        "article": "Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and a number of hormones. There are two main types: acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur; symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss fatty stool and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection bleeding diabetes mellitus or problems with other organs.The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are a gallstone blocking the common bile duct after the pancreatic duct has joined; and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma certain medications infections such as mumps and tumors. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats high blood calcium some medications and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.Acute pancreatitis is usually treated with intravenous fluids pain medication and sometimes antibiotics. Typically eating and drinking are disallowed and a nasogastric tube is placed in the stomach. A procedure known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done to examine the distal common bile duct and remove a gallstone if present. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis in addition to the above temporary feeding through a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and pancreatic enzyme replacement may be required. Occasionally surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.Globally in 2015 about 8.9 million cases of pancreatitis occurred. This resulted in 132700 deaths up from 83000 deaths in 1990. Acute pancreatitis occurs in about 30 per 100000 people a year. New cases of chronic pancreatitis develop in about 8 per 100000 people a year and currently affect about 50 per 100000 people in the United States. It is more common in men than women. Often chronic pancreatitis starts between the ages of 30 and 40 and is rare in children. Acute pancreatitis was first described on autopsy in 1882 while chronic pancreatitis was first described in 1946."

It is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy in developing countries. In the developed world it is commonly used to treat seizures in young children while other medications are generally used in older children and adults. In developed countries it is used for veterinary purposes. It may be used intravenously injected into a muscle or taken by mouth. The injectable form may be used to treat status epilepticus. Phenobarbital is occasionally used to treat trouble sleeping anxiety and drug withdrawal and to help with surgery. It usually begins working within five minutes when used intravenously and half an hour when administered by mouth. Its effects last for between four hours and two days.Side effects include a decreased level of consciousness along with a decreased effort to breathe. There is concern about both abuse and withdrawal following long-term use. It may also increase the risk of suicide. It is pregnancy category B or D (depending on how it is taken) in the United States and category D in Australia meaning that it may cause harm when taken by pregnant women. If used during breastfeeding it may result in drowsiness in the baby. A lower dose is recommended in those with poor liver or kidney function as well as elderly people. Phenobarbital like other barbiturates works by increasing the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.Phenobarbital was discovered in 1912 and is the oldest still commonly used anti-seizure medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines."

        "article": "Preterm birth also known as premature birth is the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks gestational age as opposed to full-term delivery at approximately 40 weeks. Extreme preterm is less than 28 weeks very early preterm birth is between 28 and 32 weeks early preterm birth occurs between 32 and 34 weeks late preterm birth is between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation. These babies are also known as premature babies or colloquially preemies (American English) or premmies (Australian English). Symptoms of preterm labor include uterine contractions which occur more often than every ten minutes and/or the leaking of fluid from the vagina before 37 weeks. Premature infants are at greater risk for cerebral palsy delays in development hearing problems and problems with their vision. The earlier a baby is born the greater these risks will be.The cause of spontaneous preterm birth is often not known. Risk factors include diabetes high blood pressure multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one baby) being either obese or underweight vaginal infections air pollution exposure tobacco smoking and psychological stress. For a healthy pregnancy medical induction of labor or cesarean section are not recommended before 39 weeks unless required for other medical reasons. There may be certain medical reasons for early delivery such as preeclampsia.Preterm birth may be prevented in those at risk if the hormone progesterone is taken during pregnancy. Evidence does not support the usefulness of bed rest. It is estimated that at least 75% of preterm infants would survive with appropriate treatment and the survival rate is highest among the infants born the latest in gestation. In women who might deliver between 24 and 37 weeks corticosteroid treatment may improve outcomes. A number of medications including nifedipine may delay delivery so that a mother can be moved to where more medical care is available and the corticosteroids have a greater chance to work. Once the baby is born care includes keeping the baby warm through skin-to-skin contact or incubation supporting breastfeeding and/or formula feeding treating infections and supporting breathing. Preterm babies sometimes require intubation.Preterm birth is the most common cause of death among infants worldwide. About 15 million babies are preterm each year (5% to 18% of all deliveries). Late preterm birth accounts for 75% of all preterm births. This rate is inconsistent across countries. In the United Kingdom 7.9% of babies are born pre-term and in the United States 12.3% of all births are before 37 weeks gestation. Approximately 0.5% of births are extremely early periviable births (20\u201325 weeks of gestation) and these account for most of the deaths. In many countries rates of premature births have increased between the 1990s and 2010s. Complications from preterm births resulted in 0.81 million deaths in 2015 down from 1.57 million in 1990. The chance of survival at 22 weeks is about 6% while at 23 weeks it is 26% 24 weeks 55% and 25 weeks about 72%. The chances of survival without any long-term difficulties are lower."

        "article": "The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston. The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East Division. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises the team's home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The \"Red Sox\" name was chosen by the team owner John I. Taylor c.\u20091908 following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"Boston Red Stockings\" including the Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves). The team has won nine World Series championships tied for the third-most of any MLB team and has played in 13 World Series. Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018. In addition they won the 1904 American League pennant but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series.The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918. However they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history dubbed the \"Curse of the Bambino\" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of star player Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their World Series championship in 1918. The Sox endured an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Series championship in 2004. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history including Enos Slaughter's \"mad dash\" in 1946 the \"Impossible Dream\" of 1967 Carlton Fisk's home run in 1975 and Bill Buckner's error in 1986. Following their victory in the 2018 World Series they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century with championships in 2004 2007 2013 and 2018. The team's history has also been marked by the team's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.The Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group which also owns Liverpool of the Premier League in England the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins and partially owns RFK Racing of the NASCAR Cup Series. They are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance. From May 15 2003 to April 10 2013 the Red Sox sold out every home game\u2014a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record. Both Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" and the Standells' \"Dirty Water\" have become anthems for the Red Sox.As of the end of the 2023 season the franchise's all-time regular-season record is 9874\u20139182\u201383 (.518)."

It is a side-story of the original game Call of Duty 2 which was released on PC and Xbox 360 in the same year.Big Red One differs from other games in the Call of Duty franchise in that it focuses on a single Allied formation in World War II: the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division which goes by the nickname Big Red One due to their unit patch which features a large red number one. The game covers the division's part in the North Africa Campaign the invasion of Sicily the landing on Omaha Beach in Europe and moving east and eventually crossing the Siegfried Line into Germany. Each chapter is book-ended with period footage from the Military Channel with voiceovers courtesy of Mark Hamill (who appeared in the Sam Fuller film The Big Red One) imitating a World War II documentary.The game also features a number of actors from the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning 2001 HBO miniseries Band of Brothers based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name about E (Easy) Company 2nd Battalion 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division as voice actors. They include Michael Cudlitz (Sgt. Denver \"Bull\" Randleman) James Madio (T-4 Frank Perconte) Frank John Hughes (Sgt. William \"Wild Bill\" Guarnere) Richard Speight Jr. (Sgt. Warren \"Skip\" Muck) Ross McCall (T-5 Joseph Liebgott) Rick Gomez (T-4 George Luz) and Rene L. Moreno (T-5 Joseph Ramirez). The box cover features actor Stephen Saux. The story and characters were written by Aaron Ginsburg and Wade McIntyre.In North America it was later released as part of a compilation pack entitled Call of Duty: Legacy for the PlayStation 2 only. The pack included Call of Duty: Finest Hour and Big Red One.A Collector's Edition was also released for both the Xbox and PlayStation 2."

This is most often as a result of a pituitary adenoma (specifically pituitary basophilism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) that stimulates the synthesis of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Pituitary adenomas are responsible for 80% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome when excluding Cushing's syndrome from exogenously administered corticosteroids. The equine version of this disease is Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction.This should not be confused with ectopic Cushing syndrome or exogenous steroid use."

        "article": "One Hot Minute is the sixth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers released on September 12 1995 by Warner Bros. Records. The worldwide success of the band's previous album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) caused guitarist John Frusciante to become uncomfortable with their popularity eventually quitting mid-tour in 1992. Following a series of short-term replacements the band hired guitarist Dave Navarro in 1993; it was his only studio album with the band. Recording for the album took place at the Sound Factory in Hollywood from June 1994 to February 1995. It marked the second collaboration between the band and producer Rick Rubin.A departure from the funk of Blood Sugar Sex Magik One Hot Minute is characterized by heavy metal riffs and psychedelic rock influences primarily due to the influence of Navarro formerly of Jane's Addiction. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober for more than five years approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects. As such the lyrics reflect mostly dark and melancholy themes. Bassist Flea sang lead vocals on \"Pea\" as well as the outro of \"Deep Kick\" and the chorus of the album outtake \"Stretch\".One Hot Minute sold more than two million copies and was certified multi-platinum and reached number four on the US Billboard 200. It also spawned three hit singles: \"Warped\" \"My Friends\" and \"Aeroplane\". Nevertheless it was considered a commercial disappointment because it sold fewer than half as many copies as Blood Sugar Sex Magik and received much less acclaim. Navarro was fired in 1998 due to his drug use after which Frusciante returned to the band."

        "article": "The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America Europe and Asia plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. Its range has increased alongside human expansion having been introduced to Australia where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia it is included on the list of the \"world's 100 worst invasive species\".The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period and colonised North America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of carnivory. Apart from its large size the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name the species often produces individuals with other colourings including leucistic and melanistic individuals. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes and the small basal southern grey desert foxes of Asia and North Africa.Red foxes are usually found in pairs or small groups consisting of families such as a mated pair and their young or a male with several females having kinship ties. The young of the mated pair remain with their parents to assist in caring for new kits. The species primarily feeds on small rodents though it may also target rabbits squirrels game birds reptiles invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators including other fox species it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators such as wolves coyotes golden jackals large predatory birds such as golden eagles and Eurasian eagle owls and medium- and large-sized felids.The species has a long history of association with humans having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution and large population the red fox is one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade.:\u200a229\u2013230\u200a Too small to pose a threat to humans it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas. Domestication of the red fox is also underway in Russia and has resulted in the domesticated silver fox."

It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs white-lined ears a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is 51\u201363.5\u00a0cm (20.1\u201325.0\u00a0in) with a 28\u201348.5\u00a0cm (11.0\u201319.1\u00a0in) tail and it weighs between 3.2 and 15\u00a0kg (7.1 and 33.1\u00a0lb). It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.The red panda was formally described in 1825. The two currently recognised subspecies the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda genetically diverged about 250000 years ago. The red panda's place on the evolutionary tree has been debated but modern genetic evidence places it in close affinity with raccoons weasels and skunks. It is not closely related to the giant panda which is a bear though both possess elongated wrist bones or \"false thumbs\" used for grasping bamboo. The evolutionary lineage of the red panda (Ailuridae) stretches back around 25\u00a0to\u00a018 million years ago as indicated by extinct fossil relatives found in Eurasia and North America.The red panda inhabits coniferous forests as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forests favouring steep slopes with dense bamboo cover close to water sources. It is solitary and largely arboreal. It feeds mainly on bamboo shoots and leaves but also on fruits and blossoms. Red pandas mate in early spring with the females giving birth to litters of up to four cubs in summer. It is threatened by poaching as well as destruction and fragmentation of habitat due to deforestation. The species has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2015. It is protected in all range countries.Community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in Nepal Bhutan and northeastern India; in China it benefits from nature conservation projects. Regional captive breeding programmes for the red panda have been established in zoos around the world. It is featured in animated movies video games comic books and as the namesake of companies and music bands."

Fans generally stand up and stretch out their arms and legs and sometimes walk around. It is a popular time to get a late-game snack or an alcoholic beverage as alcohol sales often cease after the last out of the seventh inning. The stretch also serves as a short break for the players.Most ballparks in professional baseball mark this point of the game by playing the crowd sing-along song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". If a game goes into a fifth extra inning a similar \"fourteenth-inning stretch\" is celebrated (as well as in theory a possible \"twenty-first-inning stretch\" or even \"twenty-eighth-inning stretch\"). In softball games amateur baseball games scheduled for only seven innings (little league plays usually six) or in minor-league doubleheaders a \"fifth-inning stretch\" may be substituted.In Japan the seventh-inning stretch consists of two parts: one after the end of the 6th inning where the away team's fight song is played as fans are encouraged to sing along. The second part is after the top of the 7th inning when the home team's fight song is played. Every team has a unique fight song that is played regardless of where they play on a given day."

        "article": "The human nose is the first organ of the respiratory system.  It is also the principal organ in the olfactory system.  The shape of the nose is determined by the nasal bones and the nasal cartilages including the nasal septum which separates the nostrils and divides the nasal cavity into two.The nose has an important function in breathing. The nasal mucosa lining the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it. Nasal conchae shell-like bones in the walls of the cavities play a major part in this process. Filtering of the air by nasal hair in the nostrils prevents large particles from entering the lungs. Sneezing is a reflex to expel unwanted particles from the nose that irritate the mucosal lining. Sneezing can transmit infections because aerosols are created in which the droplets can harbour pathogens.Another major function of the nose is olfaction the sense of smell. The area of olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity contains specialised olfactory cells responsible for this function.The nose is also involved in the function of speech. Nasal vowels and nasal consonants are produced in the process of nasalisation. The hollow cavities of the paranasal sinuses act as sound chambers that modify and amplify speech and other vocal sounds.There are several plastic surgery procedures that can be done on the nose known as rhinoplasties available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose. Defects may be congenital or result from nasal disorders or from trauma. These procedures are a type of reconstructive surgery. Elective procedures to change a nose shape are a type of cosmetic surgery."

        "article": "The history of radiation protection begins at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries with the realization that ionizing radiation from natural and artificial sources can have harmful effects on living organisms. As a result the study of radiation damage also became a part of this history.While radioactive materials and X-rays were once handled carelessly increasing awareness of the dangers of radiation in the 20th century led to the implementation of various preventive measures worldwide resulting in the establishment of radiation protection regulations. Although radiologists were the first victims they also played a crucial role in advancing radiological progress and their sacrifices will always be remembered. Radiation damage caused many people to suffer amputations or die of cancer. The use of radioactive substances in everyday life was once fashionable but over time the health effects became known. Investigations into the causes of these effects have led to increased awareness of protective measures. The dropping of atomic bombs during World War II brought about a drastic change in attitudes towards radiation. The effects of natural cosmic radiation radioactive substances such as radon and radium found in the environment and the potential health hazards of non-ionizing radiation are well-recognized. Protective measures have been developed and implemented worldwide monitoring devices have been created and radiation protection laws and regulations have been enacted.In the 21st century regulations are becoming even stricter. The permissible limits for ionizing radiation intensity are consistently being revised downward. The concept of radiation protection now includes regulations for the handling of non-ionizing radiation.In the Federal Republic of Germany radiation protection regulations are developed and issued by the Federal Ministry for the Environment Nature Conservation Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV). The Federal Office for Radiation Protection is involved in the technical work. In Switzerland the Radiation Protection Division of the Federal Office of Public Health is responsible and in Austria the Ministry of Climate Action and Energy.\u00a0"

The population suffering from the disease in Israel at the time was composed primarily of newly-arrived immigrants and populations who were expected to emigrate mostly from North Africa as well as some from Middle East and elsewhere but many Jewish children were irradiated in their home countries regardless of their intent to emigrate.The irradiation of Mizrahi children is viewed by activists in Israel as the most salient example of injustices encountered in the 1950s as a result of shortcomings or irresponsibility on the part of authorities in the absorption in Israeli society of new immigrants.A documentary about the affair titled The Ringworm Children (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d6\u05d6\u05ea; Yaldei Hagazezet) was released in 2003. The film which claims that 100000 children received radiations doses thousands of times beyond what is safe was lauded at film festivals. However in 2018 the film's creator distanced himself from it claiming that it \"doesn't meet the scientific criteria.\" The exact number of Mizrahim who suffered health complications as a result of the treatment is unclear. A study by the Israeli Ministry of Health  in coordination with UNICEF who assisted in the purchase of x-rays for the project estimated that 15000 children were irradiated during this period. One non-profit established to represent patients asserts that the number is as high as 200000."

The disease is primarily caused by dermatophytes in the genera Trichophyton and Microsporum that invade the hair shaft. The clinical presentation is typically single or multiple patches of hair loss sometimes with a 'black dot' pattern (often with broken-off hairs) that may be accompanied by inflammation scaling pustules and itching. Uncommon in adults tinea capitis is predominantly seen in pre-pubertal children more often boys than girls.At least eight species of dermatophytes are associated with tinea capitis. Cases of Trichophyton infection predominate from Central America to the United States and in parts of Western Europe. Infections from Microsporum species are mainly in South America Southern and Central Europe Africa and the Middle East. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by humans animals or objects that harbor the fungus. The fungus can also exist in a carrier state on the scalp without clinical symptomatology. Treatment of tinea capitis requires an oral antifungal agent; griseofulvin is the most commonly used drug but other newer antimycotic drugs such as terbinafine itraconazole and fluconazole have started to gain acceptance."

        "article": "Buruli ulcer () is an infectious disease characterized by the development of painless open wounds. The disease is limited to certain areas of the world most cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia. The first sign of infection is a small painless nodule or area of swelling typically on the arms or legs. The nodule grows larger over days to weeks eventually forming an open ulcer. Deep ulcers can cause scarring of muscles and tendons resulting in permanent disability.Buruli ulcer is caused by skin infection with bacteria called Mycobacterium ulcerans. The mechanism by which M.\u00a0ulcerans is transmitted from the environment to humans is not known but may involve the bite of an aquatic insect or the infection of open wounds. Once in the skin M. ulcerans grows and releases the toxin mycolactone which blocks the normal function of cells resulting in tissue death and immune suppression at the site of the ulcer.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating Buruli ulcer with a combination of the antibiotics rifampicin and clarithromycin. With antibiotic administration and proper wound care small ulcers typically heal within six months. Deep ulcers and those on sensitive body sites may require surgery to remove dead tissue or repair scarred muscles or joints. Even with proper treatment Buruli ulcer can take months to heal. Regular cleaning and dressing of wounds aids healing and prevents secondary infections.In 2018 WHO received 2713 reports of Buruli ulcer globally. Although rare it typically occurs in rural areas near slow-moving or stagnant water. The first written description of the disease is credited to Albert Ruskin Cook in 1897 at Mengo Hospital in Uganda. Fifty years later the causative bacterium was isolated and identified by a group at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. In 1998 WHO established the Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative to coordinate global efforts to eliminate Buruli ulcer. WHO considers it a neglected tropical disease."

He was Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne for almost 60 years. During his mother's reign he was largely excluded from political influence and came to personify the fashionable leisured elite. He married Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863 and the couple had six children. As Prince of Wales Edward travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and of the Indian subcontinent in 1875 proved popular successes but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.Edward inherited the throne upon his mother's death in 1901. The King played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902. He re-instituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries especially France for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\" but his relationship with his nephew German Emperor Wilhelm\u00a0II was poor. The Edwardian era which covered Edward's reign and was named after him coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911 which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords. Edward was succeeded by his only surviving son George\u00a0V."

Influenced by electrotherapy and escharotics\u2014the medical application of caustic substances\u2014doctors began using radiation to treat growths and lesions produced by diseases such as lupus basal cell carcinoma and epithelioma. Radiation was generally believed to have bactericidal properties so when radium was discovered in addition to treatments similar to those used with x-rays it was also used as an additive to medical treatments for diseases such as tuberculosis where there were resistant bacilli.Additionally because radiation was found to exist in hot spring waters which were reputed for their curative powers it was marketed as a wonder cure for all sorts of ailments in patent medicine and quack cures. It was believed by medical science that small doses of radiation would cause no harm and the harmful effects of large doses were temporary.The widespread use of radium in medicine ended when it was discovered that physical tolerance was lower than expected and exposure caused long term cell damage that could appear in carcinoma up to 40 years after treatment. The use of radiation continues today as a treatment for cancer in radiation therapy."

        "article": "The great auk (Pinguinus impennis) is a species of flightless alcid that became extinct in the mid-19th century.  It was the only modern species in the genus Pinguinus. It is not closely related to the Southern Hemisphere birds now known as penguins which were discovered later by Europeans and so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk which were called penguins.It bred on rocky remote islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. When not breeding they spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada Greenland Iceland the Faroe Islands Norway Ireland and Great Britain.The bird was 75 to 85 centimetres (30 to 33 inches) tall and weighed about 5 kilograms (11 pounds) making it the largest alcid to survive into the modern era and the second-largest member of the alcid family overall (the prehistoric Miomancalla was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked with grooves on its surface. During summer great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter the great auk lost these patches instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) long rendering the bird flightless. Instead the great auk was a powerful swimmer a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish including Atlantic menhaden and capelin and crustaceans. Although agile in the water it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around six weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after two to three weeks although the parents continued to care for it.The great auk was an important part of many Native American cultures both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with great auk bones. One burial discovered included someone covered by more than 200 great auk beaks which are presumed to be the remnants of a cloak made of great auks' skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the great auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait reducing its numbers. The bird's down was in high demand in Europe a factor that largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Scientists soon began to realize that the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws but these proved ineffectual.Its growing rarity increased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844 the last two confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey off the coast of Iceland ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A report of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithological Society was named The Auk (now Ornithology) in honour of the bird until 2021."

Two islets Haszard Island and Newcome Rock lie east offshore of Macauley Island. The island is mostly surrounded by high cliffs that make accessing it difficult; the inland parts are mostly gently sloping terrain covered with ferns and grasses.The island was formed during several volcanic episodes that produced mainly basaltic rocks as lava flows. During the Holocene a large explosive eruption produced the Sandy Bay Tephra; this eruption may have had a volume of more than 100 cubic kilometres (24\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) and the Macauley caldera might have formed during that occasion. Later the Haszard Formation built most of the current surface of Macauley Island. Two uncertain eruptions took place during the 19th century offshore Macauley Island; a hydrothermal vent system is active on Macauley Cone in the caldera.Macauley Island is an important breeding place for numerous seabirds which come on land only to reproduce. While the island is uninhabited Polynesians and during the 19th century whalers introduced goats pigs and rats which damaged the island's ecosystem. During the 20th and 21st century these invasive species were largely eradicated leading to a recovery of the previous vegetation. The island is part of a protected area."

        "article": "Monowai Seamount is a volcanic seamount to the north of New Zealand. It is formed by a large caldera and a volcanic cone just south-southeast from the caldera. The volcanic cone rises to depths of up to 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) but its depth varies with ongoing volcanic activity including sector collapses and the growth of lava domes. The seamount and its volcanism were discovered after 1877 but only in 1980 was it named \"Monowai\" after a research ship of the same name.The subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Australia Plate has given rise to volcanic and hydrothermal activity on the Kermadec Ridge that Monowai is part of. The volcano is located at the site where the Osbourn Trough and the Louisville seamount chain subduct in the Tonga Trench and this subduction process probably has influenced its volcanism. Monowai is one of the most active volcanoes in the Kermadec volcanic arc with many eruptions since 1977 and perhaps the most active submarine volcano in the world. Volcanic activity is characterised by the emission of gas and discolouration of water along with seismic activity and a substantial growth rate of the volcano.  The ongoing hydrothermal activity has also been observed and hydrothermal vents on Monowai feature a rich variety of fauna."

        "article": "Tooth decay also known as cavities or caries is the breakdown of teeth due to acids produced by bacteria. The cavities may be a number of different colors from yellow to black. Symptoms may include pain and difficulty eating. Complications may include inflammation of the tissue around the tooth tooth loss and infection or abscess formation. Tooth regeneration is an on-going stem cell based field of study that is trying to reverse the effects of decay unlike most current methods which only try to make dealing with the effects easier.The cause of cavities is acid from bacteria dissolving the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel dentin and cementum). The acid is produced by the bacteria when they break down food debris or sugar on the tooth surface. Simple sugars in food are these bacteria's primary energy source and thus a diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than buildup from sources such as saliva caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva such as diabetes mellitus Sj\u00f6gren syndrome and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include antihistamines and antidepressants. Dental caries are also associated with poverty poor cleaning of the mouth and receding gums resulting in exposure of the roots of the teeth.Prevention of dental caries includes regular cleaning of the teeth a diet low in sugar and small amounts of fluoride. Brushing one's teeth twice per day and flossing between the teeth once a day is recommended. Fluoride may be acquired from water salt or toothpaste among other sources. Treating a mother's dental caries may decrease the risk in her children by decreasing the number of certain bacteria she may spread to them. Screening can result in earlier detection. Depending on the extent of destruction various treatments can be used to restore the tooth to proper function or the tooth may be removed. There is no known method to grow back large amounts of tooth. The availability of treatment is often poor in the developing world. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be taken for pain.Worldwide approximately 3.6\u00a0billion people (48% of the population) have dental caries in their permanent teeth as of 2016. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly all adults have dental caries at some point in time. In baby teeth it affects about 620\u00a0million people or 9% of the population. They have become more common in both children and adults in recent years. The disease is most common in the developed world due to greater simple sugar consumption but less common in the developing world. Caries is Latin for \"rottenness\"."

It concerns alveolar epithelium pulmonary capillary endothelium basement membrane and perivascular and perilymphatic tissues. It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage but in interstitial lung disease the repair process is disrupted and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The disease presents itself with the following symptoms: shortness of breath nonproductive coughing fatigue and weight loss which tend to develop slowly over several months. The average rate of survival for someone with this disease is between three and five years. The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from obstructive airways diseases.There are specific types in children known as children's interstitial lung diseases. The acronym ChILD is sometimes used for this group of diseases.Thirty to 40% of those with interstitial lung disease eventually develop pulmonary fibrosis which has a median survival of 2.5-3.5 years. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is interstitial lung disease for which no obvious cause can be identified (idiopathic) and is associated with typical findings both radiographic (basal and pleural-based fibrosis with honeycombing) and pathologic (temporally and spatially heterogeneous fibrosis histopathologic honeycombing and fibroblastic foci).In 2015 interstitial lung disease together with pulmonary sarcoidosis affected 1.9 million people. They resulted in 122000 deaths."

Today the Cheyenne people are split into two federally recognized nations: the Southern Cheyenne who are enrolled in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma and the Northern Cheyenne who are enrolled in the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana. The Cheyenne comprise two Native American tribes the S\u00f3'taeo'o or S\u00f3'ta\u00e9taneo'o (more commonly spelled as Suhtai or Sutaio) and the Ts\u00e9ts\u00eah\u00e9st\u00e2hese (also spelled Tsitsistas [t\u0361s\u026at\u0361sh\u026ast\u02b0\u0251s]). The tribes merged in the early 19th century.At the time of their first European contact the Cheyenne lived in what is now Minnesota. They were close allies of the Arapaho and loosely aligned with the Lakota. By the early 18th century they were forced west by other tribes across the Missouri River and into North and South Dakota where they adopted the horse culture. Having settled the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Powder River Country of present-day Montana and Wyoming they introduced the horse culture to Lakota people about 1730. With the Arapaho the Cheyenne pushed the Kiowa to the Southern Plains. In turn they were pushed west by the more numerous Lakota.The main group of Cheyenne the Ts\u00eah\u00e9st\u00e1no was once composed of ten bands that spread across the Great Plains from southern Colorado to the Black Hills in South Dakota. They fought their historic enemies the Crow and later (1856\u201379) the United States Army. In the mid-19th century the bands began to split with some bands choosing to remain near the Black Hills while others chose to remain near the Platte Rivers of central Colorado.The Northern Cheyenne known in Cheyenne either as Notameohm\u00e9s\u00eahese meaning \"Northern Eaters\" or simply as Ohm\u00e9s\u00eahese meaning \"Eaters\" live in southeastern Montana on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. Tribal enrollment figures as of late 2014 indicate that there are approximately 10840 members of which about 4939 reside on the reservation. Approximately 91% of the population are Native Americans (full or part race) with 72.8% identifying themselves as Cheyenne. Slightly more than one-quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English. The Southern Cheyenne known in Cheyenne as He\u00e9v\u00e2hetaneo'o meaning \"Roped People\" together with the Southern Arapaho form the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in western Oklahoma. Their combined population is 12130 as of 2008. In 2003 approximately 8000 of these identified themselves as Cheyenne although with continuing intermarriage it has become increasingly difficult to separate the tribes."

Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated sheep. Like all ruminants sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla the even-toed ungulates. Numbering a little over one billion domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a ewe ( yoo) an intact male as a ram occasionally a tup a castrated male as a wether and a young sheep as a lamb.Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia with Iran being a geographic envelope of the domestication center. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes sheep are raised for fleeces meat (lamb hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber and is usually harvested by shearing. In Commonwealth countries ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones; in the United States meat from both older and younger animals is usually called lamb. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today and are also occasionally raised for pelts as dairy animals or as model organisms for science.Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era Australia New Zealand the southern and central South American nations and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.There is a large lexicon of unique terms for sheep husbandry which vary considerably by region and dialect. Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word sc\u0113ap. A group of sheep is called a flock. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist generally related to lambing shearing and age.Being a key animal in the history of farming sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture and are represented in much modern language and symbolism. As livestock sheep are most often associated with pastoral Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies\u2014such as the Golden Fleece\u2014and major religions especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual sheep are used as sacrificial animals."

Captured in 1290 by the son of William de\u00a0Briouze the Cambro-Norman Lord of Gower he was tried and found guilty of having killed thirteen men. Cragh was hanged just outside Swansea within sight of de\u00a0Briouze's Swansea Castle twice as the gallows collapsed during his first hanging. Lady Mary de\u00a0Briouze interceded on Cragh's behalf and prayed to the deceased Bishop of Hereford Thomas de Cantilupe requesting him to ask God to bring Cragh back from the dead. Cragh began to show signs of life the day after his execution and over the subsequent few weeks made a full recovery living at least another eighteen years.The main primary source for Cragh's story is the record of the investigation into the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe which is held in the Vatican Library. Cragh's resurrection was one of thirty-eight miracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining the evidence for Cantilupe's saintliness. The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission after which nothing more is known of him. Cantilupe was formally canonised by Pope John\u00a0XXII on 17 April 1320."

Because various species of mites also infect plants birds and reptiles the term \"mange\" or colloquially \"the mange\" suggesting poor condition of the skin and fur due to the infection is sometimes reserved for pathological mite-infestation of nonhuman mammals. Thus mange includes mite-associated skin disease in domestic mammals (cats and dogs) in livestock (such as sheep scab) and in wild mammals (for example foxes coyotes cougars and wombats). Severe mange caused by mites has been observed in wild bears. Since mites belong to the arachnid subclass Acari (also called Acarina) another term for mite infestation is acariasis.Parasitic mites that cause mange in mammals embed themselves in either skin or hair follicles in the animal depending upon their genus. Sarcoptes spp. burrow into skin while Demodex spp. live in follicles.In humans these two types of mite infections which would be known as \"mange\" in furry mammals are instead known respectively as scabies and demodicosis."

Humans become infested by Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis; other mammals can be infested with different varieties of the mite. They include wild and domesticated dogs and cats (in which it is one cause of mange) ungulates wild boars bovids wombats koalas and great apes.The Italian biologists Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo and Diacinto Cestoni showed in the 17th century that scabies is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei; this discovery of the itch mite in 1687 marked scabies as the first disease of humans with a known microscopic causative agent. The disease produces intense itchy skin rashes when the impregnated female tunnels into the stratum corneum of the skin and deposits eggs in the burrow. The larvae which hatch in three to 10 days move about on the skin moult into a nymphal stage and then mature into adult mites. The adult mites live three to four weeks in the host's skin."

Along with other closely related species it causes the potato disease common scab which is an economically important disease in many potato growing areas. It was first described in 1892 being classified as a fungus before being renamed in 1914 and again in 1948. Several other species of Streptomyces cause similar diseases to S. scabiei but other more closely related species do not.The genome of S. scabiei has been sequenced and is the largest Streptomyces genome known so far. The genome contains a pathogenicity island containing the genes required for S. scabiei to infect plants and which can be transferred between different species. S. scabiei can produce several related toxins which are the most responsible for its pathogenicity but several other systems have also been identified which contribute. It can infect young seedlings of all plants as well as mature root and tuber crops but is most often associated with causing common scab of potato."

Nine of the band's singles charted on the UK Singles Chart Top 40.The band briefly dissolved after Music for Pleasure (1977) the follow-up to their debut studio album was critically dismissed. They quickly reformed without Brian James and released Machine Gun Etiquette (1979). In the 1980s they released four studio albums: The Black Album (1980) Strawberries (1982) Phantasmagoria (1985) and Anything (1986) which saw the band moving toward a gothic rock style. The latter two albums did not feature Sensible who had left the band in 1984. In 1988 James and Sensible rejoined to play a series of reunion gigs one of which was released the next year as the live album Final Damnation (1989). Their fast-driven punk rock has been cited for influencing and shaping the emergence of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United Kingdom and the United States.The Damned again reformed for a tour in 1991. In 1995 they released a new studio album Not of This Earth which was Scabies's last with the band. This was followed by Grave Disorder (2001) So Who's Paranoid? (2008) and Evil Spirits (2018) their first studio album in the Official Charts top-10 list landing at No. 7. Their most recent album Darkadelic was released in 2023. Despite experiencing numerous lineup changes the formation of Vanian Sensible keyboardist Monty Oxymoron drummer Pinch and bassist Stu West had been together from 2004 until 2017 when West left the band and former bassist Paul Gray rejoined. In 2019 drummer Pinch left the band and in February 2022 he was replaced by Will Taylor who left in November 2023 when Scabies rejoined.As one of the first gothic rock bands the Damned featuring lead singer Vanian's baritone singing dark lyrics and vampire-themed costume were a major influence on the goth subculture."

In 1990 he was convicted in Virginia United States of America of murdering the parents of his then-girlfriend Elizabeth Haysom. For her role in the deaths Haysom was convicted of two counts of accessory before the fact to murder.In prison S\u00f6ring claimed he was not guilty. After fourteen parole requests and numerous petitions for a gubernatorial pardon - all unsuccessful - he was released on probation and deported to Germany in 2019. S\u00f6ring appears on talk shows has an exclusive contract with Netflix and uses his case in the media. In Germany for legal reasons S\u00f6ring is not allowed to accuse his ex-girlfriend of the crime. Instead S\u00f6ring portrayed himself as a victim and critic of an unjust US justice system.The killings took place at the Haysom residence in the Boonsboro area of Lynchburg Virginia in March 1985. S\u00f6ring (along with Elizabeth Haysom) fled the United States shortly thereafter. They were arrested in London in April 1986. His fight against extradition led to the landmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Soering v United Kingdom which establishes that his extradition to the USA would've been unlawful due to the prevalence of the pyschological 'death row phenomenon' which would violate Article 3 of the ECHR (prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment). S\u00f6ring was extradited after the authorities in Bedford County gave assurances that they would not seek the death penalty.Following his arrest in 1986 S\u00f6ring confessed to the murders during interrogation by police but at his trial in 1990 he pleaded not guilty claiming he confessed to shield Haysom from prosecution believing that he had diplomatic immunity. S\u00f6ring was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. Alleging irregularities in the investigation leading to his arrest and in his trial in the years following his conviction S\u00f6ring filed a number of legal appeals and post-conviction petitions. All were rejected by the courts. During his incarceration S\u00f6ring converted from Buddhism to Roman Catholicism and wrote multiple books about his life in prison and his religious beliefs. His 2007 book The Convict Christ was awarded first prize by the Catholic Press Association of North America in the category \"Social Concerns\"."

        "article": "On February 14 2018 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland Florida United States killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. Cruz a former student at the school fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students and was arrested without incident approximately one hour and twenty minutes later in nearby Coral Springs. Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".The incident is the deadliest mass shooting at a high school in U.S. history. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise Nevada and in Sutherland Springs Texas in October and November 2017.Students at Parkland founded Never Again MSD an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9 Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of more school resource officers.The Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him. This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel. A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.On October 20 2021 Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022. After suffering numerous delays in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic the trial commenced on July 18 2022. On October 13 2022 a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On November 2 2022 Cruz was sentenced to life without parole in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation. The unanimity required to impose the death penalty has since been overturned by a bill signed by Governor Ron DeSantis partly as a result of Cruz's sentencing."

Other symptoms may include a runny nose cough headache difficulty swallowing swollen lymph nodes and a hoarse voice. Symptoms usually last 3\u20135 days but can be longer depending on cause. Complications can include sinusitis and acute otitis media. Pharyngitis is a type of upper respiratory tract infection.Most cases are caused by a viral infection. Strep throat a bacterial infection is the cause in about 25% of children and 10% of adults. Uncommon causes include other bacteria such as gonococcus fungi irritants such as smoke allergies and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Specific testing is not recommended in people who have clear symptoms of a viral infection such as a cold. Otherwise a rapid antigen detection test or throat swab is recommended. PCR testing has become common as it is as good as taking a throat swab but gives a faster result. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include epiglottitis thyroiditis retropharyngeal abscess and occasionally heart disease.NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can be used to help with the pain. Numbing medication such as topical lidocaine may also help. Strep throat is typically treated with antibiotics such as either penicillin or amoxicillin. It is unclear whether steroids are useful in acute pharyngitis other than possibly in severe cases but a recent (2020) review found that when used in combination with antibiotics they moderately improved pain and the likelihood of resolution.About 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any 3-month period. Two or three episodes in a year are not uncommon. This resulted in 15 million physician visits in the United States in 2007. Pharyngitis is the most common cause of a sore throat. The word comes from the Greek word pharynx meaning \"throat\" and the suffix -itis meaning \"inflammation\"."

This results in the horses picking up their front feet higher and faster than they would do naturally. Sometimes called \"fixing\" it is an abusive and prohibited practice illegal in the U.S. under the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA).  It is closely associated with a unique high-stepping action of the front legs called \"big lick\" movement in show ring  Tennessee Walking Horses.  Under normal circumstances \"big lick\" action is normally created by horseshoes that have added pads and weight (sometimes called \"stacks\") usually combined with additional weighted chains or rollers placed around the pasterns to create dramatic high-stepping action of the horse's front legs desired in the horse show ring.  Practitioners of soring do so because they believe that the pain associated with this practice exaggerates the \"big lick\" to a greater degree and gives them a competitive edge over horses that are not treated in this manner.  Other breeds that have a history of soring abuses include the Racking Horse and the Spotted Saddle Horse. Both criminal and civil penalties can be assessed against individuals who engage in soring. Soring practices include the application of chemicals such as mustard oil or diesel fuel misuse of mechanical  devices such as overweight chains or engaging in practices such as trimming a hoof to expose the sensitive tissue. Tennessee Walking Horses are not allowed to be shown without passing a USDA and HPA physical inspection for current and past evidence of soring. This includes scarring on their pastern as it is associated with soring.Soring is often confused with specialized shoeing for animated performance. While controversy also surrounds the use of long toes stacked pads and weighted chains around the pasterns to enhance a horse\u2019s gait this is separate from the practice of soring."

Common symptoms include fever sore throat red tonsils and enlarged lymph nodes in the front of the neck. A headache and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.Strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person spread by talking coughing or sneezing or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching the mouth nose or eyes. As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing talking and even singing. It may be spread directly through touching infected sores.  It may also be spread by contact with skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made based on the results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms.Prevention is with  airborne precautions frequent hand washing and not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people until fever is gone and for at least 12 hours after starting treatment.  Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.Strep throat is a common bacterial infection in children. It is the cause of 15\u201340% of sore throats among children and 5\u201315% among adults. Cases are more common in late winter and early spring. Potential complications include rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess."

Newly formed nodules often swell with sweating (which is pathognomonic for the condition) but this diminishes over time.Sebaceous glands are glands located within the skin and are responsible for secreting an oily substance named sebum. They are commonly associated with hair follicles but they can be found in hairless regions of the skin as well. Their secretion lubricates the skin protecting it from drying out or becoming irritated.Sebaceous hyperplasia generally affects newborns as well as middle-aged to elderly adults. The symptoms of this condition are 1\u20135\u00a0mm papules on the skin mainly on the forehead nose and cheeks and seborrheic facial skin. The papules may be cauliflower-shaped.

The breed is characterized by medium size reddish brown in colour with white markings on the leg and forehead. They are hardy and drought tolerant. Males are horned and ewes are polled. Wattles are found in about 73% females and 69% males.  They feed on grass and a variety of tree leaves including those of Albizzia Ficus Leucaena Gliricidia Erythrina Inga dulce and Thespesia. The breed is maintained mostly for meat and is one of five hairy breeds from Tamil Nadu. The breed has been traditionally developed and maintained in the Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur district by Naicker and Pillai communities. In an outbreak of sheep pox there was a mortality of up to 10% among adults while the mortality was about 37% in adults of Mechery sheep. A virus similar to that causing Rift Valley Fever has also been noted to affect the sheep in an outbreak 1994. They breed during July to September."

        "article": "The smallpox vaccine is the first vaccine to have been developed against a contagious disease. In 1796 British physician Edward Jenner demonstrated that an infection with the relatively mild cowpox virus conferred immunity against the deadly smallpox virus. Cowpox served as a natural vaccine until the modern smallpox vaccine emerged in the 20th century. From 1958 to 1977 the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a global vaccination campaign that eradicated smallpox making it the only human disease to be eradicated. Although routine smallpox vaccination is no longer performed on the general public the vaccine is still being produced to guard against bioterrorism biological warfare and mpox.The term vaccine derives from the Latin word for cow reflecting the origins of smallpox vaccination. Edward Jenner referred to cowpox as variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow). The origins of the smallpox vaccine became murky over time especially after Louis Pasteur developed laboratory techniques for creating vaccines in the 19th century. Allan Watt Downie demonstrated in 1939 that the modern smallpox vaccine was serologically distinct from cowpox and vaccinia was subsequently recognized as a separate viral species. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed that vaccinia is most closely related to horsepox and the cowpox strains found in Great Britain are the least closely related to vaccinia."

Research continued following World War II as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of biological agents and weapons. Over the course of its 27-year history the program weaponized and stockpiled seven bio-agents \u2014 Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) Francisella tularensis (tularemia) Brucella spp (brucellosis) Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever) Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus Botulinum toxin (botulism) and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The US also pursued basic research on many more bio-agents. Throughout its history the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.In 1969 President Richard Nixon ended all offensive (i.e. non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. biodefense programs however have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by the United Nations."

        "article": "A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat destroy it and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.Vaccines can be  prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen) or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity in which infection is prevented completely.The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio measles and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available for twenty-five different preventable infections.The first recorded use of inoculation to prevent smallpox occurred in the 16th century in China with the earliest hints of the practice in China coming during the 10th century. It was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced. The folk practice of inoculation against smallpox was brought from Turkey to Britain in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow) the term devised by Edward Jenner (who both developed the concept of vaccines and created the first vaccine) to denote cowpox. He used the phrase in 1798 for the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae Known as the Cow Pox in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox. In 1881 to honor Jenner Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed. The science of vaccine development and production is termed vaccinology."

Common signs include a rash of the forehead with swelling of the eyelid. There may also be eye pain and redness inflammation of the conjunctiva cornea or uvea and sensitivity to light. Fever and tingling of the skin and allodynia near the eye may precede the rash. Complications may include visual impairment increased pressure within the eye chronic pain and stroke.The underlying mechanism involves a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) within the trigeminal ganglion supplying the ophthalmic nerve (the first division of the trigeminal nerve). Diagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms. Alternatively fluid collected from the rash may be analyzed for VZV DNA using real-time PCR. This test is rapid easy to perform and is highly sensitive and specific method for diagnosing this condition.Treatment is generally with antiviral pills such as acyclovir. Steroid eye drops and drops to dilate the pupil may also be used. The herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for prevention in those over the age of 50. HZO is the second most common manifestation of shingles the first being involvement of skin of the thorax. Shingles affects up to one half million people in the United States per year of which 10% to 25% is HZO."

Historically shingles also known as shakes were split from straight grained knot free bolts of wood. Today shingles are mostly made by being cut which distinguishes them from shakes which are made by being split out of a bolt.Wooden shingle roofs were prevalent in the North American colonies (for example in the Cape-Cod-style house) while in central and southern Europe at the same time thatch slate and tile were the prevalent roofing materials. In rural Scandinavia wood shingles were a common roofing material until the 1950s. Wood shingles are susceptible to fire and cost more than other types of shingle so they are not as common today as in the past.Distinctive shingle patterns exist in various regions created by the size shape and application method. Special treatments such as swept valleys combed ridges decorative butt ends and decorative patterns impart a special character to each building. Wood shingles can also be shaped by steam bending to create a thatch-like appearance with unique roof details and contours."

Shingles provokes a painful rash with blisters and can be followed by chronic pain (postherpetic neuralgia) as well as other complications. Older people are more often affected as are people with weakened immune systems (immunosuppression). Both shingles and postherpetic neuralgia can be prevented by vaccination.Two zoster vaccines have been approved for use in people over 50 years old. Shingrix (GSK) is a recombinant subunit vaccine which has been used in many countries since 2017. Zostavax (Merck) in use since 2006 is an attenuated vaccine which consists of a larger-than-normal dose of chickenpox vaccine. Unlike Shingrix Zostavax is not suitable for people with immunosuppression or diseases that affect the immune system. Zostavax was discontinued in the United States in November 2020.Shingrix appears to prevent more cases of shingles than Zostavax although side effects seem to be more frequent.Another vaccine known as varicella vaccine is used to prevent diseases caused by the same virus."

        "article": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The first known case was identified in Wuhan China in December 2019. Most scientists believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus entered into human populations through natural zoonosis similar to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks and consistent with other pandemics in human history. Social and environmental factors including climate change natural ecosystem destruction and wildlife trade increased the likelihood of such zoonotic spillover.  The disease quickly spread worldwide resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.The symptoms of COVID\u201119 are variable but often include fever fatigue cough breathing difficulties loss of smell and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia) while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea hypoxia or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure shock or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some complications result in death. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months or years after infection and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.COVID\u201119 transmission occurs when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes nose or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.Testing methods for COVID-19 to detect the virus's nucleic acid include real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011PCR) transcription-mediated amplification and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT\u2011LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries many of which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing quarantining ventilation of indoor spaces use of face masks or coverings in public covering coughs and sneezes hand washing and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. While drugs have been developed to inhibit the virus the primary treatment is still symptomatic managing the disease through supportive care isolation and experimental measures."

They are a pressing issue in rural areas amongst developing countries all over the world. While diarrhea and vomiting are the most commonly reported symptoms of waterborne illness other symptoms can include skin ear respiratory or eye problems. Lack of clean water supply sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are major causes for the spread of waterborne diseases in a community. Therefore reliable access to clean drinking water and sanitation is the main method to prevent waterborne diseases.Microorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria many of which are intestinal parasites or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses.Yet other important classes of waterborne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda that is to say \"roundworms\". As an example of waterborne Nematode infections one important waterborne nematode disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease.Another class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae a family of blood flukes. They usually infect people that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide."

It rapidly grows in the affected cell attaches itself to the tissue under the skin in that area and depending on the tumour it can spread to other parts of the body. Although cancer accounts for approximately 32% of deaths in cats over ten years old it can be successfully treated if diagnosed early.While the causes of cancer in cats are unknown feline leukemia virus is suspected to be a prime contributor. Other factors suspected to increase rates of feline cancer include toxins from the environment passive smoking excessive grooming or licking parts of the body that have been in contact with an environmental toxin.Cancer can be detected at an early stage by observing certain signs and symptoms. Common diagnostic methods include physical examination x-rays ultrasounds cytology blood tests urine tests and nuclear scans.

        "article": "Cancer is caused by genetic changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and genomic instability. A minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations. Most cancers are related to environmental lifestyle or behavioral exposures.  Cancer is generally not contagious in humans though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria. The term \"environmental\" as used by cancer researchers refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans. The environment is not limited to the biophysical environment (e.g. exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight) but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors.Over one third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75\u201380% in the United States) are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors. Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents (tobacco use accounts for 25\u201330% of cancer deaths) environmental pollutants diet and obesity (30\u201335%) infections (15\u201320%) and radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing up to 10%). These factors act at least partly by altering the function of genes within cells. Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect to consider when evaluating the risk factors for the development of particular cancers. Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer."

People with dark skin are often referred to as \"black people\" although this usage can be ambiguous in some countries where it is also used to specifically refer to different ethnic groups or populations.The evolution of dark skin is believed to have begun around 1.2\u00a0million years ago in light-skinned early hominid species after they moved from the equatorial rainforest to the sunny savannas. In the heat of the savannas better cooling mechanisms were required which were achieved through the loss of body hair and development of more efficient perspiration. The loss of body hair led to the development of dark skin pigmentation which acted as a mechanism of natural selection against folate (vitamin B9) depletion and to a lesser extent DNA damage. The primary factor contributing to the evolution of dark skin pigmentation was the breakdown of folate in reaction to ultraviolet radiation; the relationship between folate breakdown induced by ultraviolet radiation and reduced fitness as a failure of normal embryogenesis and spermatogenesis led to the selection of dark skin pigmentation. By the time modern Homo sapiens evolved all humans were dark-skinned.Humans with dark skin pigmentation have skin naturally rich in melanin (especially eumelanin) and have more melanosomes which provide superior protection against the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation. This helps the body to retain its folate reserves and protects against damage to DNA.Dark-skinned people who live in high latitudes with mild sunlight are at an increased risk\u2014especially in the winter\u2014of vitamin D deficiency. As a consequence of vitamin D deficiency they are at a higher risk of developing rickets numerous types of cancers and possibly cardiovascular disease and low immune system activity. However some recent studies have questioned if the thresholds indicating vitamin D deficiency in light-skinned individuals are relevant for dark-skinned individuals as they found that on average dark-skinned individuals have higher bone density and lower risk of fractures than lighter-skinned individuals with the same levels of vitamin D. This is possibly attributed to lower presence of vitamin D binding agents (and thus its higher bioavailability) in dark-skinned individuals.The global distribution of generally dark-skinned populations is strongly correlated with the high ultraviolet radiation levels of the regions inhabited by them. These populations with the exception of indigenous Tasmanians almost exclusively live near the equator in tropical areas with intense sunlight: Africa Australia Melanesia New Guinea South Asia Southeast Asia West Asia and the Americas. Studies into non-African populations indicates dark skin is not necessarily a retention of the pre-existing high UVR-adapted state of modern humans before the out of Africa migration but may in fact be a later evolutionary adaptation to tropical rainforest regions. Due to mass migration and increased mobility of people between geographical regions in the recent past dark-skinned populations today are found all over the world."

        "article": "Light skin is a human skin color that has a low level of eumelanin pigmentation as an adaptation to environments of low UV radiation. Light skin is most commonly found amongst the native populations of Europe East Asia West Asia and Central Asia as measured through skin reflectance. People with light skin pigmentation are often referred to as \"white\" although these usages can be ambiguous in some countries where they are used to refer specifically to certain ethnic groups or populations.Humans with light skin pigmentation have skin with low amounts of eumelanin and possess fewer melanosomes than humans with dark skin pigmentation. Light skin provides better absorption qualities of ultraviolet radiation which helps the body to synthesize higher amounts of vitamin D for bodily processes such as calcium development. On the other hand light-skinned people who live near the equator where there is abundant sunlight are at an increased risk of folate depletion. As a consequence of folate depletion they are at a higher risk of DNA damage birth defects and numerous types of cancers especially skin cancer. Humans with darker skin who live further from the tropics may have lower vitamin D levels which can also lead to health complications both physical and mental including a greater risk of developing schizophrenia. These two observations form the \"vitamin D\u2013folate hypothesis\" which attempts to explain why populations that migrated away from the tropics into areas of low UV radiation evolved to have light skin pigmentation.The distribution of light-skinned populations is highly correlated with the low ultraviolet radiation levels of the regions inhabited by them. Historically light-skinned populations almost exclusively lived far from the equator in high latitude areas with low sunlight intensity. Due to colonization imperialism and increased mobility of people between geographical regions in recent centuries light-skinned populations today are found all over the world."

        "article": "A transdermal patch is a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream. An advantage of a transdermal drug delivery route over other types of medication delivery (such as oral topical intravenous or intramuscular) is that the patch provides a controlled release of the medication into the patient usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir of medication or through body heat melting thin layers of medication embedded in the adhesive. The main disadvantage to transdermal delivery systems stems from the fact that the skin is a very effective barrier; as a result only medications whose molecules are small enough to penetrate the skin can be delivered by this method. The first commercially available prescription patch was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 1979. These patches administered scopolamine for motion sickness.In order to overcome restriction from the skin researchers have developed microneedle transdermal patches (MNPs) which consist of an array of microneedles which allows a more versatile range of compounds or molecules to be passed through the skin without having to micronize the medication beforehand. MNPs offer the advantage of controlled release of medication and simple application without medical professional assistance required. With advanced MNPs technology drug delivery can be specified for local usage for example skin whitener MNPs that are applied to the face. Many types of MNPs have been developed to penetrate tissues other than skin such as internal tissues of the mouth and digestive tract. These promote faster and more direct delivery of the molecule to the targeted area."

They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term hemorrhoid is often used to refer to the disease. The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present. Internal hemorrhoids often result in painless bright red rectal bleeding when defecating. External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus. If bleeding occurs it is usually darker. Symptoms frequently get better after a few days. A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.While the exact cause of hemorrhoids remains unknown a number of factors that increase pressure in the abdomen are believed to be involved. This may include constipation diarrhea and sitting on the toilet for long periods. Hemorrhoids are also more common during pregnancy. Diagnosis is made by looking at the area. Many people incorrectly refer to any symptom occurring around the anal area as hemorrhoids and serious causes of the symptoms should not be ruled out. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is reasonable to confirm the diagnosis and rule out more serious causes.Often no specific treatment is needed. Initial measures consist of increasing fiber intake drinking fluids to maintain hydration NSAIDs to help with pain and rest. Medicated creams may be applied to the area but their effectiveness is poorly supported by evidence. A number of minor procedures may be performed if symptoms are severe or do not improve with conservative management. Surgery is reserved for those who fail to improve following these measures.Approximately 50% to 66% of people have problems with hemorrhoids at some point in their lives. Males and females are both affected with about equal frequency. Hemorrhoids affect people most often between 45 and 65\u00a0years of age and they are more common among the wealthy. Outcomes are usually good. The first known mention of the disease is from a 1700 BC Egyptian papyrus."

About 40% of all mammal species are rodents. They are native to all major land masses except for New Zealand Antarctica and several oceanic islands though they have subsequently been introduced to most of these land masses by human activity.Rodents are extremely diverse in their ecology and lifestyles and can be found in almost every terrestrial habitat including human-made environments. Species can be arboreal fossorial (burrowing) saltatorial/richochetal (leaping on their hind legs) or semiaquatic. However all rodents share several morphological features including having only a single upper and lower pair of ever-growing incisors. Well-known rodents include mice rats squirrels prairie dogs porcupines beavers guinea pigs and hamsters. Rabbits hares and pikas who also have incisors that grow continuously (but have two pairs of upper incisors instead of one) were once included with them but are now considered to be in a separate order the Lagomorpha. Nonetheless Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups sharing a single common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires.Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies short limbs and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food excavate burrows and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material but some have more varied diets. They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy to polygyny to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped altricial young while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.The rodent fossil record dates back to the Paleocene on the supercontinent of Laurasia. Rodents greatly diversified in the Eocene as they spread across continents sometimes even crossing oceans. Rodents reached both South America and Madagascar from Africa and until the arrival of Homo sapiens were the only terrestrial placental mammals to reach and colonize Australia.Rodents have been used as food for clothing as pets and as laboratory animals in research. Some species in particular the brown rat the black rat and the house mouse are serious pests eating and spoiling food stored by humans and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive and have caused the extinction of numerous species such as island birds the dodo being an example previously isolated from land-based predators."

Symptoms may include a severe sunburn after only a few minutes in the sun freckling in sun-exposed areas dry skin and changes in skin pigmentation. Nervous system problems such as hearing loss poor coordination loss of intellectual function and seizures may also occur. Complications include a high risk of skin cancer with about half having skin cancer by age 10 without preventative efforts and cataracts. There may be a higher risk of other cancers such as brain cancers.XP is autosomal recessive with mutations in at least nine specific genes able to result in the condition. Normally the damage to DNA which occurs in skin cells from exposure to UV light is repaired by nucleotide excision repair. In people with xeroderma pigmentosum this damage is not repaired. As more abnormalities form in DNA cells malfunction and eventually become cancerous or die. Diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.There is no cure for XP. Treatment involves completely avoiding the sun. This includes protective clothing sunscreen and dark sunglasses when out in the sun. Retinoid creams may help decrease the risk of skin cancer. Vitamin D supplementation is generally required. If skin cancer occurs it is treated in the usual way. The life expectancy of those with the condition is about 30 years less than normal.The disease affects about 1 in 100000 worldwide. By region it affects about 1 in 370 in India 1 in 20000 in Japan 1 in 250000 people in the United States and 1 in 430000 in Europe. It occurs equally commonly in males and females. Xeroderma pigmentosum was first described in the 1870s by Moritz Kaposi. In 1882 Kaposi coined the term xeroderma pigmentosum for the condition referring to its characteristic dry pigmented skin. Individuals with the disease have been referred to as \"children of the night\" or \"moon children\"."

This leads to stasis of blood which predisposes to the formation of blood clots. Uncommon variations of MTS have been described such as the right common iliac vein getting compressed by the right common iliac artery.In the 21st century the May\u2013Thurner syndrome definition has been expanded to a broader disease profile known as nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL) which can involve both the right and left iliac veins as well as multiple other named venous segments. This syndrome frequently manifests as pain when the limb is dependent (hanging down the edge of a bed/chair) and/or significant swelling of the whole limb."

The adult has a streaked brown back and whitish grey underparts which are unstreaked except on the undertail coverts. The sexes are identical as with most warblers but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers it is insectivorous. Four to seven eggs are laid in a nest on or near the ground in thick vegetation or in a tussock of grass.This is a species which skulks in the undergrowth creeping through bushes and low foliage and which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing from a prominent position. The song which gives this species its name is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling often given at dawn or dusk."

Humans like most animals have no mechanism to regulate excess iron simply losing a limited amount through various means like sweating or menstruating.Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs disrupting their normal function. The most susceptible organs include the liver heart pancreas skin joints gonads thyroid and pituitary gland; patients can present with cirrhosis polyarthropathy hypogonadism heart failure or diabetes.There are five types of hereditary hemochromatosis: type 1 2 (2A 2B) 3 4 and 5 all caused by mutated genes. Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 is the most frequent and unique related to the HFE gene. It is most common among those of Northern European ancestry in particular those of Celtic descent.The disease follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene involved in each cell to develop the condition. In most cases when a person has this autosomal recessive condition their parents act as carriers. Carriers possess one copy of the mutated gene but do not manifest any signs or symptoms associated with the disease and are referred to as carriers. The unaffected carrier parents play an integral role in transmitting one copy of the mutated gene to their child who ultimately develops the disease. However carriers may experience iron overload themselves at a later stage if certain factors come into play. Still in most cases they remain asymptomatic throughout their lives unless other genetic or environmental factors contribute to excessive iron accumulation within their bodies."

It also encompasses analyses of the potential causes of skin diseases at a basic level. Dermatopathologists work in close association with clinical dermatologists with many possessing further clinical training in dermatology. The field was founded by German dermatologist and physician Gustav Simon who published the first textbook on dermatopathology 'Skin Diseases Illustrated by Anatomical Investigations' (Die Hautkrankheiten durch anatomische Untersuchungen erl\u00e4utert) in 1848.Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances anatomic distributions and behavior. Sometimes however those criteria do not allow a conclusive diagnosis to be made and a skin biopsy is taken to be examined under the microscope or are subject to other molecular tests. That process reveals the histology of the disease and results in a specific diagnostic interpretation. In some cases additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies including immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry electron microscopy flow cytometry and molecular-pathologic analysis.One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist including cutaneous eruptions (\"rashes\") and neoplasms (dermatological oncology deals with pre-cancers such as an actinic keratosis; and cancers including both benign masses and malignant cancers- such as basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma and most dangerously malignant melanoma). Non-cancerous conditions include vitiligo impetigo purpura pruritus spider veins warts moles oral or genital herpes chancre sores of syphilis exposure to poison ivy and similar plants or other venom sources rashes cysts abscesses corns and dermabrasions or cases dealing with wrinkles peeling skin or autoimmune attacks on the skin. Therefore dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine.Certification in dermatopathology in the United States and several other countries requires the completion of a medical degree followed by residency training of 3 years in dermatology or 3 years in anatomic pathology (often completed as part of a 4-year combined residency in anatomic pathology and clinical pathology). Thereafter an additional 1 or 2 years of post-residency education in dermatopathology is undertaken. For trainees with a primary background in pathology the fellowship experience includes the equivalent of 6 months of clinical dermatology and for those whose training is primarily in dermatology 6 months of the fellowship are devoted to anatomic pathology. In the United States dermatopathologists are first certified by the American Boards of Pathology or Dermatology or the American Osteopathic Boards of Pathology or Dermatology in the United Kingdom dermatopathologist are certified by the Royal College of Pathologist and in the rest of the world by the International Board of Dermatopathology. Trainees then obtain subspecialty certification (termed \"special competence\") or Diploma in dermatopathology by written examination. Since 2003 the International Board of Dermatopathology (IBDP)\u2014headquartered in Graz Austria\u2014also has certified candidates from countries around the world. This is done by IBDP review of applicants' professional qualifications and a written and practical examination that is given in Europe each year.In the United States dermatopathology is practiced in a variety of settings. Some biopsies are interpreted by the dermatologists who obtained them some are sent to pathology laboratories and interpreted either by general pathologists or dermatopathologists while others are interpreted at specialized dermatopathology laboratories. Only a few of the latter exist outside of the United States."

In adults sclerotherapy is often used to treat spider veins smaller varicose veins hemorrhoids and hydroceles.Sclerotherapy is one method for the treatment of spider veins varicose veins (which are also often treated with surgery radiofrequency and laser ablation) and venous malformations. In ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy ultrasound is used to visualize the underlying vein so the physician can deliver and monitor the injection. Sclerotherapy often takes place under ultrasound guidance after venous abnormalities have been diagnosed with duplex ultrasound. Sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance and using microfoam sclerosants has been shown to be effective in controlling reflux from the sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions. However some authors believe that sclerotherapy is not suitable for veins with reflux from the greater or lesser saphenous junction or for veins with axial reflux. This is due to the emergence of more effective technologies including laser ablation and radiofrequency which have demonstrated superior efficacy to sclerotherapy for treatment of these veins."

Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are those of the pulmonary and fetal circulations which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In the systemic circulation arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart in the deep veins.There are three sizes of veins: large medium and small. Smaller veins are called venules and the smallest the post-capillary venules are microscopic that make up the veins of the microcirculation. Veins are often closer to the skin than arteries.Veins have less smooth muscle and connective tissue and wider internal diameters than arteries. Because of their thinner walls and wider lumens they are able to expand and hold more blood. This greater capacity gives them the term of capacitance vessels. At any time nearly 70% of the total volume of blood in the human body is in the veins. In medium and large sized veins the flow of blood is maintained by one-way (unidirectional) venous valves to prevent backflow. In the lower limbs this is also aided by muscle pumps also known as venous pumps that exert pressure on intramuscular veins when they contract and drive blood back to the heart."

Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years they became one of the most culturally influential acts in popular music. The band initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspired many later punk post-punk and alternative rock musicians while their clothing and hairstyles were a significant influence on the early punk image.The Sex Pistols' first line-up consisted of vocalist Johnny Rotten (born John Lydon) guitarist Steve Jones drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock with Matlock replaced by Sid Vicious (born John Richie) in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren the band gained widespread attention from British press after swearing live on-air during a December 1976 television interview. Their May 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\" which described the monarchy as a \"fascist regime\" was released to coincide with national celebrations for the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The song was rapidly banned from being played by the BBC and by nearly every independent radio station in Britain making it the most censored record in British history.Their debut album Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols (1977) was a UK number one and is regarded as seminal in the development of punk rock. In January 1978 at the final gig of a difficult and media-hyped tour of the US Rotten announced the band's break-up live on stage. Over the next few months the three remaining members recorded songs for McLaren's film of the Sex Pistols' story The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979 following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Rotten Jones Cook and Matlock later reunited for a successful tour in 1996. Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade.The Sex Pistols have been recognised as a highly influential band. In 2006 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame although true to their image they refused to attend the ceremony with Rotten  referring to the museum as \"a piss stain\"."

Their unique musical style predated the rhythm and blues and rock and roll musical genres and the subgenre doo-wop. The Ink Spots were widely accepted in both the white and black communities largely due to the ballad style introduced to the group by lead singer Bill Kenny.In 1989 the Ink Spots (Bill Kenny Charlie Fuqua Deek Watson Jerry Daniels and Orville Jones) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 1999 they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Since the Ink Spots disbanded in 1954 there have been well over a hundred vocal groups calling themselves \"The Ink Spots\" with and without any original members of the group. It has often been the case that these groups claimed to be \"second generation\" or \"third generation\" Ink Spots."

Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing a hoarse voice enlarged lymph nodes (\"glands\") around the collarbone a dry cough and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC) which is more common in the developing world and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco alcohol very hot drinks poor diet and chewing betel nut. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco obesity and acid reflux.The disease is diagnosed by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment is based on the cancer's stage and location together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery palliative care is often recommended.As of 2018 esophageal cancer was the eighth-most common cancer globally with 572000 new cases during the year. It caused about 509000 deaths that year up from 345000 in 1990. Rates vary widely among countries with about half of all cases occurring in China. It is around three times more common in men than in women. Outcomes are related to the extent of the disease and other medical conditions but generally tend to be fairly poor as diagnosis is often late. Five-year survival rates are around 13% to 18%."

Included in the World Health Organization's classification of ovarian cancer it mainly affects women above 45 years of age. Survival depends on how advanced the disease is and how different or similar the individual cancer cells are.Squamous ovarian carcinoma is a recognized but uncommon diagnosis often originating from a transformation of mature cystic teratoma (MCT). Unlike other squamous cell carcinomas factors like UV exposure and tobacco use play a less significant role. Chronic inflammation in MCT and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are linked to its development. The tumor emerges through metaplasia of the ovarian surface epithelium. While MCT is the primary source in most cases others are associated with endometriosis or Brenner tumor and rare metastasis from other organs can also lead to squamous ovarian carcinoma.Treatment for oSCC involves surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy but efficacy of these treatments is unclear. While there is no well-studied chemotherapy regimen for ovarian SCCs platinum-based chemotherapy is often used.The earliest reported instance of pure primary SCC was by Ben-Baruchet in 1988; oSSC emerging from pre-existing lesions have been recorded since the early 1950s."

It is defined as neoplasia of epithelial tissue that has glandular origin glandular characteristics or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of carcinomas but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word where these exist. Thus invasive ductal carcinoma the most common form of breast cancer is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name\u2014however esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of esophageal cancer esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.In the most specific usage the glandular origin or traits are exocrine; endocrine gland tumors such as a VIPoma an insulinoma or a pheochromocytoma are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called neuroendocrine tumors. Epithelial tissue sometimes includes but is not limited to the surface layer of skin glands and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body. Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the germ layers (ectoderm endoderm or mesoderm). To be classified as adenocarcinoma the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a gland as long as they have secretory properties. Adenocarcinoma is the malignant counterpart to adenoma which is the benign form of such tumors. Sometimes adenomas transform into adenocarcinomas but most do not.Well-differentiated adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not. By staining the cells from a biopsy a pathologist can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer. Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body and more fundamentally to the potency of epithelial cells. While each gland may not be secreting the same substance as long as there is an exocrine function to the cell it is considered glandular and its malignant form is therefore named adenocarcinoma."

It may also occur sporadically. Both males and females may be affected.The onset at puberty is presumably due to hormonal stimulus of the pilosebaceous unit. They most often arise on the chest and may also occur on the abdomen upper arms armpits and face. In some cases cysts may develop all over the body.The cysts are mostly small (2\u201320 mm) but they may be several centimetres in diameter. They tend to be soft to firm semi-translucent bumps and contain an oily yellow liquid. Sometimes a small central punctum can be identified and they may contain one or more hairs (eruptive vellus hair cysts). They may become inflamed and heal with scarring like acne nodules (see nodulocystic acne and hidradenitis suppurativa).On inflammation they can become incredibly painful and reach sizes between 4-6cm in diameter. The area around the cyst can become red and painful to the touch; making mobility sitting strenuous movement or everyday activities very difficult and painful.

These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein) acne high blood pressure liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS) and left ventricular hypertrophy. These risks are further increased when athletes take steroids alongside other drugs causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. In women and children AAS can cause irreversible masculinization.Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports racing and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Athletes have been looking for drugs to enhance their athletic abilities since the Olympics started in Ancient Greece. For many years AAS have been by far the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited laboratories. Anabolic steroids are classified as Schedule III controlled substances in many countries meaing that AAS have recognized medical use but are also recognized as having a potential for abuse and dependence leading to their regulation and control. In countries where AAS are controlled substances there is often a black market in which smuggled clandestinely manufactured or even counterfeit drugs are sold to users."

The effects of DMPS on heavy metal poisoning including with polonium-210 were investigated in the following years. DMPS was found to have some protective effect prolonging the survival time.A study was undertaken of DMPS use by workers involved in the production of a calomel skin bleaching lotion and in direct contact with mercurous chloride and that already showed elevated urine mercury levels. The sodium salt of DMPS was found to be effective in lowering the body burden of mercury and in decreasing the urinary mercury concentration to normal levels.DMPS administered to a mercury poisoned animal model failed to remove the mercury from tissues and reduce the inorganic mercury burden in the brain indicating it is not a useful intra-cellular chelation agent. A 2008 study reported a case of Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) a potentially serious disease in a child undergoing chelation therapy with DMPS; the SJS resolved gradually after the chelation therapy was stopped.A 2020 study found DMPS to provide some benefits taken orally in mitigating effects from hemotoxic snakebites (using venom from saw-scaled vipers Viperidae Echis) in mouse models when given soon after exposure suggesting its potential for repurposing as a prehospital treatment.

In more severe cases SCARs also involves serious damage to internal organs. SCARs includes five syndromes: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (i.e. DRESS syndrome also termed Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [DIHS]); Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS); Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap syndrome (SJS/TEN); and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). The five disorders have similar pathophysiologies i.e. disease-causing mechanisms for which new strategies are in use or development to identify individuals predisposed to develop the SCARs-inducing effects of specific drugs and thereby avoid treatment with them. Maculopapular rash (MPR) is a less-well defined and benign form of drug-induced adverse skin reactions; while not classified in the SCARs group it shares with SCARS a similar pathophysiology and is caused by some of the same drugs which cause SCARs.Adverse drug reactions are major therapeutic problems estimated to afflict up to 20% of inpatients and 25% of outpatients. About 90% of these adverse reactions take the form of benign morbilliform rash hypersensitivity drug reactions such as MPR. However they also include more serious reactions: a) pseudo-allergic reactions in which a drug directly stimulates mast cells basophils and/or eosinophils to release pro-allergic mediators (e.g. histamine); b) Type I Type II and Type III hypersensitivity reactions of the adaptive immune system mediated by IgE IgG and/or IgM antibodies; and c) SCARs and MPR which are Type IV hypersensitivity reactions of the innate immune system initiated by lymphocytes of the T cell type and mediated by various types of leukocytes and cytokines.Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are off-target drug reactions i.e. reactions in which a drug causes toxicity by impacting a biological target other than the one(s) for which it is intended. They are T cell-initiated delayed hypersensitivity reactions occurring selectively in individuals who may be predisposed to do so because of the genetically-based types of human leukocyte antigens (i.e. HLA) or T-cell receptors they express; the efficiency with which they absorb distribute to tissues metabolize and eliminate a drug or drug metabolite; or less well-defined idiosyncrasies.SCARs are here considered as a group focusing on the similarities and differences in their pathophysiologies clinical presentations instigating drugs and recommendations for drug avoidance.

Pinafore The Pirates of Penzance Patience Iolanthe and The Mikado in which the protagonist Able Seaman Dick Deadeye (voiced by Spinetti) is sent by Queen Victoria on a quest to recover the \"Ultimate Secret\" from the Sorcerer who has stolen it. The music is borrowed from many Savoy operas with new or modified lyrics by Robin Miller and orchestrations updated in a contemporary popular style by conductor Jimmy Horowytz."

Gilbert described by the author as \"An Operatic Extravaganza Founded on Donizetti's opera La figlia del regimento.\"  In the French or other continental armies a vivandi\u00e8re was a woman who supplied food and drink to troops in the field.The piece was first produced at St. James's Hall Liverpool on 15 June 1867. It was then presented in London with a mostly new cast at the Queen's Theatre Long Acre opening on 22 January 1868. It was part of a series of operatic burlesques and other broad comic pieces that Gilbert wrote in the late 1860s near the beginning of his playwriting career. It was modestly successful and introduced some themes and satiric techniques that Gilbert would later employ in his famous Savoy operas."

        "article": "The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso among humans and other primates. Both sexes develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. The relative size and development of the breasts is a major secondary sex distinction between males and females.In females it serves as the mammary gland which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple and these tissues give the breast its distinct size and globular shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules or clusters of alveoli where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. During pregnancy the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones including estrogens progesterone and prolactin that mediate the completion of its development namely lobuloalveolar maturation in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding.Humans are the only animals with permanently developed breasts in females. At puberty estrogens in conjunction with growth hormone cause permanent breast growth in female humans. This happens only to a much lesser extent in other primates\u2014breast development in other primates generally only occurs with pregnancy. Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture art and photography. They can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness. A number of cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts especially the nipples are an erogenous zone."

Those with the condition tend to be tall and thin with long arms legs fingers and toes. They also typically have exceptionally flexible joints and abnormally curved spines. The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm. The lungs eyes bones and the covering of the spinal cord are also commonly affected. The severity of the symptoms is variable.MFS is caused by a mutation in FBN1 one of the genes that make fibrillin which results in abnormal connective tissue. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. In about 75% of cases it is inherited from a parent with the condition while in about 25% it is a new mutation. Diagnosis is often based on the Ghent criteria family history and genetic testing (DNA analysis).There is no known cure for MFS. Many of those with the disorder have a normal life expectancy with proper treatment. Management often includes the use of beta blockers such as propranolol or atenolol or if they are not tolerated calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. Surgery may be required to repair the aorta or replace a heart valve. Avoiding strenuous exercise is recommended for those with the condition.About 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10000 people have MFS. Rates of the condition are similar in different regions of the world. It is named after French pediatrician Antoine Marfan who first described it in 1896."

Usually on the belly these striae also commonly occur on the breasts thighs hips lower back and buttocks. Pregnancy-related striae are known as striae gravidarum. Striae may also be influenced by the hormonal changes associated with puberty pregnancy bodybuilding or hormone replacement therapy.There is no evidence that creams used during pregnancy prevent stretch marks.

        "article": "Glacial striations or striae are scratches or gouges cut into bedrock by glacial abrasion. These scratches and gouges were first recognized as the result of a moving glacier in the late 18th century when Swiss alpinists first associated them with moving glaciers. They also noted that if they were visible today that the glaciers must also be receding.Glacial striations are usually multiple straight and parallel representing the movement of the glacier using rock fragments and sand grains embedded in the base of the glacier as cutting tools. Large amounts of coarse gravel and boulders carried along underneath the glacier provide the abrasive power to cut trough-like glacial grooves. Finer sediments also in the base of the moving glacier further scour and polish the bedrock surface forming a glacial pavement. Ice itself is not a hard enough material to change the shape of rock but because the ice has rock embedded in the basal surface it can effectively abrade the bedrock.Most glacial striations were exposed by the retreat of glaciers since the Last Glacial Maximum or the more recent Little Ice Age. As well as indicating the direction of flow of the glacial ice the depth and extent of weathering of the striations may be used to estimate the duration of post-glacier exposure of the rock.An outstanding example of glacial grooves can be found at the Glacial Grooves at Kelleys Island Ohio (a National Natural Landmark) the most impressive of which is 120 metres (400\u00a0ft) long 10 metres (35\u00a0ft) wide and up to 3 metres (10\u00a0ft) deep.  These grooves cut into the Columbus Limestone. Striations cover the sides and bottoms of the grooves.Other examples of glacial striations can be found in the former path of the Moiry Glacier south of Grimentz Anniviers Valais Switzerland alongside the present path of the glacier north-east of the 2016 location of the tongue of the glacier (images)."

Gynecomastia can cause significant psychological distress or unease.Gynecomastia can be normal in: newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother; adolescent boys going through puberty; older men over age 50; and obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease kidney failure thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors. Alcohol and some drugs can also cause breast enlargement. Other causes may include Klinefelter syndrome metabolic dysfunction or a natural decline in testosterone production. This may occur even if the levels of estrogens and androgens are both appropriate but the ratio is altered.Gynecomastia is the most common benign disorder of the male breast tissue and affects 35% of men being most prevalent between the ages of 50 and 69. It is normal for up to 70% of adolescent boys to develop gynecomastia to some degree. Of these 75% resolve within two years of onset without treatment. If the condition does not resolve within 2 years or if it causes embarrassment pain or tenderness treatment is warranted. Medical treatment of gynecomastia that has persisted beyond two years is often ineffective. Gynecomastia is different from \"pseudogynecomastia\" which is commonly present in men with obesity.Medications such as aromatase inhibitors have been found to be effective and even in rare cases of gynecomastia from disorders such as aromatase excess syndrome or Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome but surgical removal of the excess tissue can be needed to correct the condition. In 2019 24123 male patients underwent the procedure in the United States accounting for a 19% increase since 2000."

Disease and disability are affected by environmental factors genetic predisposition disease agents and lifestyle choices and are dynamic processes that begin before individuals realize they are affected. Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal primary secondary and tertiary prevention.Each year millions of people die of preventable causes. A 2004 study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures. Leading causes included cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease unintentional injuries diabetes and certain infectious diseases. This same study estimates that 400000 people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. According to estimates made by the World Health Organization (WHO) about 55 million people died worldwide in 2011 and two-thirds of these died from non-communicable diseases including cancer diabetes and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases. This is an increase from the year 2000 during which 60% of deaths were attributed to these diseases.Preventive healthcare is especially important given the worldwide rise in the prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases. There are many methods for prevention of disease. One of them is prevention of teenage smoking through information giving. It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups even if they feel healthy to perform disease screening identify risk factors for disease discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle stay up to date with immunizations and boosters and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider. In pediatrics some common examples of primary prevention are encouraging parents to turn down the temperature of their home water heater in order to avoid scalding burns encouraging children to wear bicycle helmets and suggesting that people use the air quality index (AQI) to check the level of pollution in the outside air before engaging in sporting activities. Some common disease screenings include checking for hypertension (high blood pressure) hyperglycemia (high blood sugar a risk factor for diabetes mellitus) hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol) screening for colon cancer depression HIV and other common types of sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia syphilis and gonorrhea mammography (to screen for breast cancer) colorectal cancer screening a Pap test (to check for cervical cancer) and screening for osteoporosis. Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer. However these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate."

        "article": "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun thereby obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of Earth totally or partially. Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months during the eclipse season in its new moon phase when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of Earth's orbit. In a total eclipse the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses only part of the Sun is obscured. Unlike a lunar eclipse which may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth a solar eclipse can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world. As such although total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years.If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and in the same orbital plane as Earth there would be total solar eclipses once a month at every new moon. Instead because the Moon's orbit is tilted at about 5 degrees to Earth's orbit its shadow usually misses Earth. Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons resulting in at least two and up to five solar eclipses each year no more than two of which can be total. Total eclipses are rarer because they require a more precise alignment between the centers of the Sun and Moon and because the Moon's apparent size in the sky is sometimes too small to fully cover the Sun.An eclipse is a natural phenomenon. In some ancient and modern cultures solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. Astronomers' predictions of eclipses began in China as early as the 4th century BC; eclipses hundreds of years into the future may now be predicted with high accuracy. Looking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage so special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. Only the total phase of a total solar eclipse is safe to view without protection. Enthusiasts known as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles travel to remote locations to see solar eclipses."

        "article": "Sun protective clothing is clothing specifically designed for sun protection and is produced from a fabric rated for its level of ultraviolet (UV) protection. A novel weave structure and denier (related to thread count per inch) may produce sun protective properties. In addition some textiles and fabrics employed in the use of sun protective clothing may be pre-treated with UV-inhibiting ingredients during manufacture to enhance their effectiveness.In addition to special fabrics sun protective clothing may also adhere to specific design parameters including styling appropriate to full coverage of the skin most susceptible to UV damage. Long sleeves ankle-length trousers knee- to floor-length skirts knee- to floor-length dresses and collars are common styles for clothing as a sun protective measure.A number of fabrics and textiles in common use today need no further UV-blocking enhancement based on their inherent fiber structure density of weave and dye components especially darker colors and indigo dyes. Good examples of these fabrics contain full percentages or blends of heavy-weight natural fibers like cotton linen and hemp or light-weight synthetics such as polyester nylon spandex and polypropylene. Natural or synthetic indigo-dyed denim twill weaves canvas and satin are also good examples.  However a significant disadvantage is the heat retention caused by heavier-weight and darker-colored fabrics.As sun protective clothing is usually meant to be worn during warm and humid weather some UV-blocking textiles and clothing may be designed with ventilated weaves moisture wicking and antibacterial properties to assist in cooling and breathability.UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) represents the ratio of sunburn-causing UV without and with the protection of the fabric similar to SPF (sun protection factor) ratings for sunscreen. While standard summer fabrics have UPF ~6 sun protective clothing typically has UPF ~30 which means that only 1 out of ~30 units of UV will pass through (~3%)."

They can sometimes also function as a visual aid as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist featuring lenses that are colored polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters then being an American slang term for glasses).Since the 1930s sunglasses have been a popular fashion accessory especially on the beach.The American Optometric Association recommends wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet radiation (UV) whenever a person is in the sunlight to protect the eyes from UV and blue light which can cause several serious eye problems. Their usage is mandatory immediately after some surgical procedures such as LASIK and recommended for a certain time period in dusty areas when leaving the house and in front of a TV screen or computer monitor after LASEK. It is important to note that dark glasses that do not block UV radiation can be more damaging to the eyes than not wearing eye protection at all because they tend to open the pupil and allow more UV rays into the eye."

Sunscreens come as lotions sprays gels foams (such as an expanded foam lotion or whipped lotion) sticks powders and other topical products. Sunscreens are common supplements to clothing particularly sunglasses sunhats and special sun protective clothing and other forms of photoprotection (such as umbrellas).Sunscreens may be classified according to the type of active ingredient(s) present in the formulation (inorganic compounds or organic molecules) as:Mineral sunscreens (also referred to as physical) which use only inorganic compounds (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) as active ingredients. These ingredients primarily work by absorbing UV rays but also through reflection and refraction.Chemical sunscreens which use organic molecules as active ingredients. These products are sometimes referred to as petrochemical sunscreens since the active organic molecules are synthesized starting from building blocks typically derived from petroleum. Chemical sunscreen ingredients also mainly work by absorbing the UV rays. Over the years some organic UV absorbers have been heavily scrutinised to assess their toxicity and a few of them have been banned in places such as Hawaii and Thailand for their impact on aquatic life and the environment.Hybrid sunscreens which contain a combination of organic and inorganic UV filters.Medical organizations such as the American Cancer Society recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas. The routine use of sunscreens may also reduce the risk of melanoma. To effectively protect against all the potential damages of UV light the use of broad-spectrum sunscreens (covering both UVA and UVB radiation) has been recommended.As of 2021 only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as currently there is insufficient data to support recognizing petrochemical UV filters as safe."

Over the period of a solar cycle levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material the number and size of sunspots solar flares and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation from a period of minimum activity to a period of a maximum activity back to a period of minimum activity.The magnetic field of the Sun flips during each solar cycle with the flip occurring when the solar cycle is near its maximum. After two solar cycles the Sun's magnetic field returns to its original state completing what is known as a Hale cycle.This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as aurora but was not clearly identified until 1843. Solar activity driven by both the solar cycle and transient aperiodic processes governs the environment of interplanetary space by creating space weather and impacting space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.Understanding and predicting the solar cycle remains one of the grand challenges in astrophysics with major ramifications for space science and the understanding of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena elsewhere in the universe.The current scientific consensus on climate change is that solar variations only play a marginal role in driving global climate change since the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the forcing due to greenhouse gases."

        "article": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive hot ball of plasma inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as visible light ultraviolet and infrared radiation providing most of the energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24000 to 28000 light-years. From Earth it is 1\u00a0AU (1.496\u00d7108\u00a0km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1391400\u00a0km (864600\u00a0mi; 4.64 LS) 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330000 times that of Earth making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%) with much smaller quantities of heavier elements including oxygen carbon neon and iron.The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) informally called a yellow dwarf though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6\u00a0billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.Every second the Sun's core fuses about 600\u00a0billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4\u00a0billion kg of matter into energy. Far in the future when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. Subsequently the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf) and no longer produce energy by fusion but it will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for trillions of years. After that it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf giving off no more energy."

They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots appear within active regions usually in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.Individual sunspots or groups of sunspots may last anywhere from a few days to a few months but eventually decay. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun with diameters ranging from 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) to 160000\u00a0km (100000\u00a0mi). Larger sunspots can be visible from Earth without the aid of a telescope. They may travel at relative speeds or proper motions of a few hundred meters per second when they first emerge.Indicating intense magnetic activity sunspots accompany other active region phenomena such as coronal loops prominences and reconnection events. Most solar flares and coronal mass ejections originate in these magnetically active regions around visible sunspot groupings. Similar phenomena indirectly observed on stars other than the Sun are commonly called starspots and both light and dark spots have been measured."

        "article": "Attercopus is an extinct genus of arachnids containing one species Attercopus fimbriunguis known from flattened cuticle fossils from the Panther Mountain Formation in Upstate New York. It is placed in the extinct order Uraraneida spider-like animals able to produce silk but which lacked true spinnerets and retained a segmented abdomen bearing a flagellum-like tail resembling that of a whip scorpion. They are thought to be close to the origins of spiders.Its name is taken from the English dialect word attercop (\"spider\") which came from Old English: attorcoppa (\"poison-head\") from Old English: ator (\"poison\") itself drawn from the Proto-Germanic *aitra- (\"poisonous ulcer\") and kopp- (\"head\"). In The Hobbit Tolkien had Bilbo use attercop to insult attacking spiders the insult possibly deriving from its meaning in Northern England dialect of \"peevish ill-natured person\".An important Early Devonian (about 390\u00a0million years ago) fossil example from Gilboa New York was originally described as a member of the extinct order Trigonotarbida and named Gelasinotarbus? fimbriunguis. It was later assigned to a new genus Attercopus and reinterpreted as the oldest and most primitive example of a true spider and described as being the first user of silk in animals.(Araneae). This hypothesis was based on the supposed presence of unique spider features such as silk-producing spinnerets and the opening of a venom gland on the fang of the chelicera.Further study \u2013 based on new fossils from a comparable Devonian locality called South Mountain \u2013 and comparison with other material from the Permian of Russia i.e. of Permarachne indicates that Attercopus does not actually have spinnerets. The feature which looked like a tubular spinneret is actually a folded sheet of cuticle. It would however have produced silk from a series of silk gland openings or spigots located across plates on the underside of the abdomen. The opening for the venom gland is also a misinterpretation. A segmented tail or flagellum also belonged to this animal.It seems unlikely that Attercopus spun webs but it may have used its silk to wrap eggs lay draglines or construct burrow walls.  Attercopus fimbriunguis is not a spider but it is probably close to the type of animals which did give rise to modern spiders today."

Mutants can have a rod or curved rod shape and these are less effective. Its helical body (from which the genus name Helicobacter derives) is thought to have evolved in order to penetrate the mucous lining of the stomach helped by its flagella and thereby establish infection. The bacterium was first identified as the causal agent of gastric ulcers in 1983 by the Australian doctors Barry Marshall and Robin Warren.Infection of the stomach with H. pylori is not the cause of illness itself; over half of the global population is infected but most are asymptomatic. Persistent colonization with more virulent strains can induce a number of gastric and extragastric disorders. Gastric disorders due to infection begin with gastritis inflammation of the stomach lining. When infection is persistent the prolonged inflammation will become chronic gastritis. Initially this will be non-atrophic gastritis but damage caused to the stomach lining can bring about the change to atrophic gastritis and the development of ulcers both within the stomach itself or in the duodenum the nearest part of the intestine. At this stage the risk of developing gastric cancer is high. However the development of a duodenal ulcer has a lower risk of cancer.Helicobacter pylori is a class 1 carcinogen and potential cancers include gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas and gastric cancer. Infection with H. pylori is responsible for around 89 per cent of all gastric cancers and is linked to the development of 5.5 per cent of all cases of cancer worldwide. H. pylori is the only bacterium known to cause cancer.Extragastric complications that have been linked to H. pylori include anemia due either to iron-deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency diabetes mellitus cardiovascular and certain neurological disorders. An inverse link has also been claimed with H. pylori having a positive protective effect on many disorders including asthma esophageal cancer IBD (including GERD and Crohn's disease) and other disorders.Some studies suggest that H.\u00a0pylori plays an important role in the natural stomach ecology by influencing the type of bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Other studies suggest that non-pathogenic strains of H.\u00a0pylori may beneficially normalize stomach acid secretion and regulate appetite.In 2023 it was estimated that about two-thirds of the world's population were infected with H.\u00a0pylori being more common in developing countries. The prevalence has declined in many countries due to eradication treatments with antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors and with increased standards of living."

Patients display a remarkable hallucinatory behavior and peculiar motor disturbances which Morvan reported under the term \u201cfibrillary chorea\u201d but which are best described in modern terms as neuromyotonic discharges.The association of the disease with thymoma tumour autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies suggests an autoimmune or paraneoplastic aetiology.

        "article": "The Picardy sweat was an infectious disease of unknown cause and one of the only diseases that bears resemblance to the English sweating sickness. The Picardy sweat is also known as the miliary fever suette des Picards in French and picard'scher Schwei\u00df picard'sches Schweissfieber or Frieselfieber in German. It appeared in the northern French province of Picardy in 1718. The Picardy sweat was mainly confined to the northwest part of France particularly in the provinces of Seine-et-Oise Bas Rhin and Oise. Although the Picardy sweat began in Northern France outbreaks also occurred in Germany Belgium Switzerland Austria and Italy. Between 1718 and 1874 194 epidemics of the Picardy sweat were recorded. The last extensive outbreak was in 1906 which a French commission attributed to fleas from field mice. A subsequent case was diagnosed in 1918 in a soldier in Picardy.There were two types of the Picardy sweat a benign form that was similar to nephropathia epidemica or milder cases of hantavirus infection and a more severe form that resembled the English sweating sickness. Similar to the English sweat the Picardy sweat was characterized by intense sweating but the symptoms were less often fatal. Other symptoms were high fever rash and bleeding from the nose. More severe symptoms included intense sweating headaches suffocation precordial pain anxiety and \"passion of the heart\" or palpitations. Unlike the English sweating sickness a miliary rash followed by desquamation or peeling of the skin often appeared three to four days after infection. The rate of sickness was anywhere from 25% to 30% of the population and the mortality rate is estimated to have been between 0% and 20%."

Other major outbreaks of the English sweating sickness occurred in 1508 1517 and 1528 with the last outbreak in 1551 after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden with death often occurring within hours. Sweating sickness epidemics were unique compared with other disease outbreaks of the time: whereas other epidemics were typically urban and long-lasting cases of sweating sickness spiked and receded very quickly and heavily affected rural populations. Its cause remains unknown although it has been suggested that an unknown species of hantavirus was responsible."

Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid either serum or plasma. However blisters can be filled with blood (known as \"blood blisters\") or with pus (for instance if they become infected).The word \"blister\" entered English in the 14th century. It came from the Middle Dutch bluyster and was a modification of the Old French blostre which meant a leprous nodule\u2014a rise in the skin due to leprosy. In dermatology today the words vesicle and bulla refer to blisters of smaller or greater size respectively.To heal properly a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary.

        "article": "In cricket a beamer (less commonly beam ball) is a type of delivery in which the ball without bouncing passes above the batsman's waist height. This kind of delivery is dangerous as a batsman will be expecting the ball to bounce on the pitch. The failure to bounce makes it much harder to avoid the ball or to hit it with the bat. It is usually an accident caused by the ball slipping from the bowler's hands at delivery but they have been bowled deliberately an act highly contrary to the Laws of Cricket and the sportsmanship expected of the players.This type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman and the penalty is an immediate no-ball and in Twenty20 and one-day matches a free hit. The use of beamers is governed under Law 41.7. The bowler is then given a warning by the umpire for dangerous bowling. Repeated or deliberate cases may result in the bowler being barred from bowling again for the remainder of the innings (or match) as happened with Waqar Younis in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Fast bowlers particularly younger players yet to fully refine their techniques are likely to bowl such deliveries more often than other bowlers albeit accidentally.A beamer may not necessarily be bowled with intent. It may be due to sweaty hands or a wet ball causing a slipped release from the hand. It is also possible that the bowler attempts to bowl a yorker which goes askew.A bowler can legally target the batsman with a ball aimed at his head that bounces called a bouncer. These are easier to play or avoid than beamers as beamers do not land on the pitch and are illegal batsman's are caught by surprise and the technique of batting using feet and body movement to meet the ball after it pitches does not apply.Abdur Rehman a Pakistani spin bowler bowled three consecutive beamers in the 2014 Asia Cup against Bangladesh and was banned from the match without actually bowling a single legitimate ball despite giving away 8 runs. This was the first time this happened in the history of cricket.Shoaib Akhtar Pakistani fast bowler admitted that he bowled a beamer against Mahendra Singh Dhoni on purpose."

        "article": "Edna Murphey was the creator of the Odorono brand of deodorant and originator of modern-day deodorant marketing strategies (1912). Murphey's father Dr. Abraham D. Murphey a physician developed the liquid antiperspirant to help surgeons with sweaty hands. Edna subsequently found this antiperspirant useful on underarms and began marketing the product to women. There had been other previous deodorant/antiperspirant inventions previous to Murphey's however Murphey's was the product that became widely distributed. Murphey called the deodorant Odorono (Odor-o-no) and started the company Odorono Co.  At the time antiperspirant products were not widely used and Murphey was for the most part unsuccessful at selling the product in the office she rented in Cincinnati. Many potential users thought the item was either unnecessary potentially harmful to their health or that the red color of the product would damage their clothing. Odorono began selling after Murphey took the product to Atlantic City in 1912 for a Summer long exposition. Subsequently Murphey began advertising the product in newspapers in major cities. In 1918 Murphey took out at US$50000 bank loan and hired James Webb Young of the J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency to create a national advertising campaign for Odorono. Early advertisements focused on addressing the idea that the product was unhealthy the ads stressed that the product had been developed by a doctor and was safe for daily use.  Then after JWT employee James Young conducted a survey on why women were not buying the product Young discovered that most women did not have a need for the deodorant. Thus in 1919 Odorono switched its advertising strategy to convince people that sweating was an embarrassing problem and as a result of this campaign Odorono sales rose 112 percent. The first ad created with this strategy appeared in Ladies' Home Journal.By 1921 Odo-ro-no (the name was updated to represent pronunciation of the word) was advertised in newspapers in England Cuba Mexico The Philippines Chile Peru Ecuador Brazil Argentina New Zealand Australia and South Africa.In 1929 Murphey sold the company to Northam Warren the inventor of the Cutex Cuticle Remover. Murphey is credited with creating the now 18 billion dollar deodorant market industry."

While approximately 5.5 million people participated the chain was broken in many places particularly in the Southwestern desert. The number of participants would have been roughly sufficient to create an unbroken chain if they had been spread out evenly along the planned route but most joined the chain in major cities and few traveled to more remote areas. The various gaps in the line between participants were filled using ribbons ropes or banners.Participants were encouraged to donate $10 to be assigned a place in the line. The proceeds were donated to local charities to fight hunger and homelessness and help those in poverty. The event raised about $15 million for charities after operating costs significantly less than organizers had hoped to collect."

        "article": "John Whiteside Parsons (born Marvel Whiteside Parsons; October 2 1914 \u2013 June 17 1952) was an American rocket engineer chemist and Thelemite occultist. Associated with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Parsons was one of the principal founders of both the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation. He invented the first rocket engine to use a castable composite rocket propellant and pioneered the advancement of both liquid-fuel and solid-fuel rockets.Born in Los Angeles Parsons was raised by a wealthy family on Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena California. Inspired by science fiction literature he developed an interest in rocketry in his childhood and in 1928 began amateur rocket experiments with school friend Edward Forman. He dropped out of Pasadena Junior College and Stanford University due to financial difficulties during the Great Depression and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate Frank Malina to form the Caltech-affiliated Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group supported by GALCIT chairman Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to work on Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) for the U.S. military. After the U.S. entered World War II they founded Aerojet in 1942 to develop and sell JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.Following some brief involvement with Marxism in 1939 Parsons converted to Thelema the new religious movement founded by the English occultist Aleister Crowley. Together with his first wife Helen Northrup Parsons joined the Agape Lodge the Californian branch of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) in 1941. At Crowley's bidding Parsons replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Boulevard. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 owing to the Lodge's infamous reputation and his hazardous workplace conduct.In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard Parsons conducted the Babalon Working a series of rituals intended to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon on Earth. He and Hubbard continued the working with Marjorie Cameron whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. then held various jobs while acting as a consultant for Israel's rocket program. Amid McCarthyism Parsons was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952 Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident but many associates suspected suicide or murder.Parsons's political and occult writings were published posthumously. Historians of Western esotericism cite him as one of the most prominent figures in propagating Thelema across North America. Although academic interest in his scientific career was negligible historians have come to recognize Parsons's contributions to rocket engineering. For these innovations his advocacy of space exploration and human spaceflight and his role in founding JPL and Aerojet Parsons is regarded as among the most important figures in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals."

In some cases the person will suffer no such fright from this while they might suffer from not knowing who they're performing to. In some cases stage fright may be a part of a larger pattern of social phobia (social anxiety disorder) but many people experience stage fright without any wider problems. Quite often stage fright arises in a mere anticipation of a performance often a long time ahead.

        "article": "A deodorant is a substance applied to the body to prevent or mask body odor caused by bacterial breakdown of perspiration for example in the armpits groin or feet. A subclass of deodorants called antiperspirants prevents sweating itself typically by blocking sweat glands. Antiperspirants are used on a wider range of body parts at any place where sweat would be inconvenient or unsafe since unwanted sweating can interfere with comfort vision and grip (due to slipping). Other types of deodorant allow sweating but prevent bacterial action on sweat since human sweat only has a noticeable smell when it is decomposed by bacteria.In the United States the Food and Drug Administration classifies and regulates most deodorants as cosmetics but classifies antiperspirants as over-the-counter drugs.The first commercial deodorant Mum was introduced and patented in the late nineteenth century by an inventor in Philadelphia Pennsylvania Edna Murphey. The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the US. The modern formulation of the antiperspirant was patented by Jules Montenier on January 28 1941. This formulation was first found in \"Stopette\" deodorant spray which Time magazine called \"the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s\".Use of deodorant with aluminium compounds has been suspected of being linked to breast cancer but research has not proven any such link."

MCS is a cancerous subtype of its benign counterpart chondroid syringoma and is the least common variation that has an approximated prevalence of less than 0.005%. These tumours mainly arise \"from sebaceous glands sweat glands and ectopic salivary glands\" (Tural Sel\u00e7ukbiricik G\u00fcnver Kar\u0131\u015fmaz and Serdengecti 2013) and are rarely encountered in radiopathological and clinical practice. The tumours commonly appear with an asymptomatic \"slow-growing painless solid subcutaneous or intradermal nodules with a normal margin\" (Obaidat Alsaad and Ghazarian 2007) and make up for less than one percent of all primary skin tumours. Commonly appearing in the limbs and body these asymmetrical tumours range from two millimetres to more than three centimetres. MCS is one of the rarest subtypes of tumours and usually requires aggressive surgery to terminate. Despite accounting for only a small number of tumours recorded each year malignant mixed tumours are easily confused with other skin conditions (such as epidermal cyst pilar cyst calcifying epithelioma or a solitary trichoepithelioma (Tural Sel\u00e7ukbiricik G\u00fcnver Kar\u0131\u015fmaz and Serdengecti 2013)) and have high potential for recurrence after surgical excision. The aggressiveness of malignant chondroid syringoma varies as 49% of cases have had local recurrence whereas some demonstrate regional lymph node or osseous metastasis. The rare neoplasms generally do not follow a determinate development path and are often difficult to diagnose.Histologically these malignant mixed tumours have epithelial and mesenchymal components and are very large nodular circumscribed and nonulcerated. They are morphologically identical to pleomorphic adenoma and have a female predilection. They range from developing deep dermal to subcutaneous nodules and metastasise at a very high rate. Malignant mixed tumours can emerge \"de nova or more rarely develop from a cartilaginous syringoma.\"(IADVL 2004)"

All ATL cells contain integrated HTLV-1 provirus further supporting that causal role of the virus in the cause of the neoplasm. A small amount of HTLV-1 individuals progress to develop ATL with a long latency period between infection and ATL development. \u00a0ATL is categorized into 4 subtypes: acute smoldering lymphoma-type chronic. Acute and Lymphoma-type are known to particularity be aggressive with poorer prognosis.Globally the retrovirus HTLV-1 is estimated to infect 20 million people per year with the incidence of ATL approximately 0.05 per 100000 per year with endemic regions such as regions of Japan as high as 27 per 100000 per year. However cases have increased in non-endemic regions with highest incidence of HTLV-1 in southern/northern islands of Japan Caribbean Central and South America intertropical Africa Romania northern Iran. ATL normally occurs around the age of 62 years but median age at diagnosis does depend on prevalence of the HTLV-1 infection in the geographic location.Current treatment regiments for ATL are based on clinical subtype and response to initial therapy. Some therapy modalities for treatment may not available in all countries therefore strategies differ across the world. All patients are referred to clinical trials if available. Beyond clinical trials treatments are centered on multiagent chemotherapy zidovudine plus interferon a (AZT/IFN) and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT)."

While a relatively rare disease it is the most common type of primary gastrointestinal T-cell lymphoma.EATL had been defined as a single type of small intestine lymphoma but in 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO) divided the disease into two subtypes: 1) EATL type I which occurs in individuals with coeliac disease a chronic immune disorder causing inflammatory responses to dietary gluten primarily in the upper reaches (i.e. jejunum and duodenum) of the small intestine; and 2) EATL type II a disorder similar to EATL type I that occurs without coeliac disease. While type I and II EATL share many similar features post-2008 studies found some significant differences between the two types. In 2016 the WHO redefined the two diseases as separate entities keeping the term enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma for the coeliac disease-associated lymphoma and terming type 2 disease as monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma (MEITL). EATL is five to ten times more common than is MEITL. The WHO also defined a third type of intestinal T-cell lymphoma that cannot not be classified as EATL or MEITL as peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (ITCL-NOS).EATL arises from the malignant transformation of small-intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). IEL are a heterogeneous group of principally T-cell lymphocytes residing in epithelial tissues that interface the environment such as the mucosa of the bronchi reproductive tract and gastrointestinal tract. At these sites IEL are exposed and regulate immune responses to non-dietary and dietary antigens pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms and injured self tissues. Gastrointestinal tract IEL appear in the epithelium of the small intestine colon stomach and esophagus residing between the epithelial cells that line these organs' lumens. These IEL often exhibit natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell cell activation markers contain various toxic agents (e.g. perforin granzyme) and therefore are capable if activated of causing severe tissue injuries. With coeliac disease the IEL react to the glutelins in dietary gluten by increasing their numbers becoming pathologically active producing chronic inflammation that injures intestinal cells interfering with nutrient absorption and creating an environment conducive to their malignant transformation into EATL.Optimal treatment of EATL has used regimens consisting of intensive chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in cases with bulky obstructive and/or perforated bowel disease surgical intervention. The disease has a five-year overall survival rate of only ~20%. However recent studies focusing on the malignant IEL in EATL have increased understanding of the disease and suggested newer chemotherapy-based strategies and novel molecular targets that might be attacked therapeutically to improve the disease's prognosis."

The World Health Organization  classifies lymphomas into five major groups including one for Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging.Treatment depends on whether the lymphoma is slow- or fast-growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy radiation immunotherapy targeted therapy stem-cell transplantation surgery or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to high numbers of antibodies plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy however increase the risk of other cancers heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades.In 2015 about 4.3 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 231400 (5.4%) died.

        "article": "The hair follicle is an organ found in mammalian skin. It resides in the dermal layer of the skin and is made up of 20 different cell types each with distinct functions. The hair follicle regulates hair growth via a complex interaction between hormones neuropeptides and immune cells. This complex interaction induces the hair follicle to produce different types of hair as seen on different parts of the body. For example terminal hairs grow on the scalp and lanugo hairs are seen covering the bodies of fetuses in the uterus and in some newborn babies. The process of hair growth occurs in distinct sequential stages: anagen is the active growth phase catagen is the regression of the hair follicle phase telogen is the resting stage exogen is the active shedding of hair phase and kenogen is the phase between the empty hair follicle and the growth of new hair.The function of hair in humans has long been a subject of interest and continues to be an important topic in society developmental biology and medicine. Of all mammals humans have the longest growth phase of scalp hair compared to hair growth on other parts of the body. For centuries humans have ascribed esthetics to scalp hair styling and dressing and it is often used to communicate social or cultural norms in societies. In addition to its role in defining human appearance scalp hair also provides protection from UV sun rays and is an insulator against extremes of hot and cold temperatures. Differences in the shape of the scalp hair follicle determine the observed ethnic differences in scalp hair appearance length and texture.There are many human diseases in which abnormalities in hair appearance texture or growth are early signs of local disease of the hair follicle or systemic illness. Well known diseases of the hair follicle include alopecia or hair loss hirsutism or excess hair growth and lupus erythematosus."

        "article": "Telogen effluvium is a scalp disorder characterized by the thinning or shedding of hair resulting from the early entry of hair in the telogen phase (the resting phase of the hair follicle). It is in this phase that telogen hairs begin to shed at an increased rate where normally the approximate rate of hair loss (having no effect on one's appearance) is 125 hairs per day.There are 5 potential alterations in the hair cycle that could lead to this shedding: immediate anagen release delayed anagen release short anagen syndrome immediate telogen release and delayed telogen release.Immediate anagen release occurs when follicles leave anagen and are stimulated to enter telogen prematurely. The effects become visible 2\u20133 months later with increased telogen effluvium.Delayed anagen release most commonly associated with pregnancy involves the prolongation of anagen under the effect of pregnancy hormones resulting in delayed but synchronous and heavy postpartum hair shedding.Short anagen syndrome is characterized by an idiopathic and persistent telogen hair shedding as well as the inability to grow hair long. This is a result of the shortening of the duration of anagen meaning a greater number of telogen hairs at any given time and is responsible for the majority of chronic TE cases.Immediate telogen release generally occurs with drug-induced shortening of telogen leading to the premature reentrance of follicles to anagen which causes a massive release of club (telogen) hairs. Drugs such as minoxidil can precipitate immediate telogen release.Delayed telogen release involves a prolonged telogen phase followed by a delayed transition to anagen. This occurs in animals with synchronous hair cycles that shed their hair or winter coats seasonally. This is also sometimes responsible for seasonal hair loss in humans.Emotional or physiological stress may result in an alteration of the normal hair cycle and cause the disorder with potential causes including eating disorders crash diets pregnancy and childbirth chronic illness major surgery anemia severe emotional disorders hypothyroidism and drugs.Diagnostic tests which may be performed to verify the diagnosis include a trichogram trichoscopy and biopsy. Effluvium can present with similar appearance to alopecia totalis with further distinction by clinical course microscopic examination of plucked follicles or biopsy of the scalp. Histology would show telogen hair follicles in the dermis with minimal inflammation in effluvium and dense peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate in alopecia totalis.Vitamin D levels may also play a role in the normal hair cycle.Many new cosmetic treatments have been reported including Stemoxydine Nioxin minoxidil and a leave-on technology combination: caffeine niacinamide panthenol dimethicone and an acrylate polymer (CNPDA). This treatment has shown to increase the diameter of existing individual scalp hair fibres by 2\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm yielding a significant increase of approximately 10% in the cross-sectional area of each hair. Additionally CNPDA-thickened hairs also demonstrate altered mechanical properties of thicker fibres; increased suppleness/pliability and increased ability to withstand force without breaking."

        "article": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by dengue virus. It is frequently asymptomatic; if symptoms appear they typically begin 3 to 14 days after infection. These may include a high fever headache vomiting muscle and joint pains and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases the disease develops into severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome) with bleeding low levels of blood platelets blood plasma leakage and dangerously low blood pressure.Dengue virus has four confirmed serotypes; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. The symptoms of dengue resemble many other diseases including malaria influenza and Zika. Blood tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting viral RNA or antibodies to the virus.There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. In mild cases treatment is focused on treating pain symptoms. Severe cases of dengue require hospitalisation; treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously.Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes genus principally Aedes aegypti. Infection can be prevented by mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. Two types of dengue vaccine have been approved and are commercially available. Dengvaxia became available in 2016 but it is only recommended to prevent re-infection in individuals who have been previously infected. The second vaccine Qdenga became available in 2022 and is suitable for adults adolescents and children from four years of age.The earliest descriptions of a dengue outbreak date from 1779; its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Already endemic in more than one hundred countries dengue is spreading from tropical and subtropical regions to the Iberian Peninsula and the southern states of the US partly attributed to climate change. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. During 2023 more than 5 million infections were reported with more than 5000 dengue-related deaths. As most cases are asymptomatic or mild the actual numbers of dengue cases and deaths are under-reported."

        "article": "Fever or pyrexia in humans is a body temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point in the hypothalamus. There is no single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature: sources use values ranging between 37.2 and 38.3\u00a0\u00b0C (99.0 and 100.9\u00a0\u00b0F) in humans. The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set point temperature returns to normal a person feels hot becomes flushed and may begin to sweat. Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure with this being more common in young children. Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42\u00a0\u00b0C (106 to 108\u00a0\u00b0F).A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening. This includes viral bacterial and parasitic infections\u2014such as influenza the common cold meningitis urinary tract infections appendicitis Lassa COVID-19 and malaria. Non-infectious causes include vasculitis deep vein thrombosis connective tissue disease side effects of medication or vaccination and cancer. It differs from hyperthermia in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.Treatment to reduce fever is generally not required. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation however may be useful and help a person rest. Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature. Children younger than three months require medical attention as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. Hyperthermia requires treatment.Fever is one of the most common medical signs. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. While fever evolved as a defense mechanism treating a fever does not appear to improve or worsen outcomes. Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved a phenomenon known as \"fever phobia.\""

It occurs in subtropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere. The name pappataci fever comes from the Italian word for sandfly; it is the union of the words pappa (usually this is used as a generic name for food but in this case it is a verb meaning \"eating\") and taci (silent) distinguishing these insects from blood-feeding mosquitoes which produce a typical noise while flying."

        "article": "Saturday Night Fever is a 1977 American dance drama film directed by John Badham and produced by Robert Stigwood. It stars John Travolta as Tony Manero a young Italian-American man who spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local discoth\u00e8que while dealing with social tensions and disillusionment in his working class ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn. The story is based on \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\" a mostly fictional 1976 article by music writer Nik Cohn.A major critical and commercial success Saturday Night Fever had a tremendous impact on the popular culture of the late 1970s. It helped popularize disco around the world and initiated a series of collaborations between film studios and record labels. It made Travolta already well known from his role in the popular TV sitcom Welcome Back Kotter a household name. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance at the time becoming the fourth-youngest nominee in the category. The film showcases aspects of the music dancing and subculture surrounding the disco era including symphony-orchestrated melodies haute couture styles of clothing pre-AIDS sexual promiscuity and graceful choreography. The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack featuring songs by the Bee Gees is one of the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide. Travolta reprised his role of Tony Manero in Staying Alive in 1983 which was panned by critics despite being successful at the box office.In 2010 Saturday Night Fever was deemed \"culturally historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.Adjusted for inflation it is one of the highest-grossing R-rated films released in the U.S. in the 1970s with a total box office gross of $673899098 in 2024."

        "article": "The 1918\u20131920 flu pandemic also known as the Great Influenza epidemic or by the common misnomer Spanish flu was an exceptionally deadly global influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus. The earliest documented case was March 1918 in the state of Kansas in the United States with further cases recorded in France Germany and the United Kingdom in April. Two years later nearly a third of the global population or an estimated 500 million people had been infected in four successive waves. Estimates of deaths range from 17 million to 50 million and possibly as high as 100 million making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.The pandemic broke out near the end of World War I when wartime censors in the belligerent countries suppressed bad news to maintain morale but newspapers freely reported the outbreak in neutral Spain creating a false impression of Spain as the epicenter and leading to the \"Spanish flu\" misnomer. Limited historical epidemiological data make the pandemic's geographic origin indeterminate with competing hypotheses on the initial spread.Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill the young and old with a higher survival rate in-between but this pandemic had unusually high mortality for young adults. Scientists offer several explanations for the high mortality including a six-year climate anomaly affecting migration of disease vectors with increased likelihood of spread through bodies of water. The virus was particularly deadly because it triggered a cytokine storm ravaging the stronger immune system of young adults although the viral infection was apparently no more aggressive than previous influenza strains. However the claim that young adults had a high mortality during the pandemic has been contested. Malnourishment overcrowded medical camps and hospitals and poor hygiene exacerbated by the war promoted bacterial superinfection killing most of the victims after a typically prolonged death bed.The 1918 Spanish flu was the first of three flu pandemics caused by H1N1 influenza A virus; the most recent one was the 2009 swine flu pandemic. The 1977 Russian flu was also caused by H1N1 virus."

Three noted cases during WWI were the authors J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R.\u00a0Tolkien A.\u00a0A.\u00a0Milne and C. S. Lewis. From 1915 to 1918 between one-fifth and one-third of all British troops reported ill had trench fever while about one-fifth of ill German and Austrian troops had the disease. The disease persists among the homeless. Outbreaks have been documented for example in Seattle and Baltimore in the United States among injection drug users and in Marseille France and Burundi.Trench fever is also called Wolhynia fever shin bone fever Meuse fever His disease and His\u2013Werner disease or Werner-His disease (after Wilhelm His Jr. and Heinrich Werner).The disease is caused by the bacterium Bartonella quintana (older names: Rochalimea quintana Rickettsia quintana) found in the stomach walls of the body louse. Bartonella quintana is closely related to Bartonella henselae the agent of cat scratch fever and bacillary angiomatosis."

        "article": "Typhoid fever also known simply as typhoid is a disease caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi bacteria also called Salmonella typhi. Symptoms vary from mild to severe and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. This is commonly accompanied by weakness abdominal pain constipation headaches and mild vomiting. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases people may experience confusion. Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months. Diarrhea may be severe but is uncommon. Other people may carry it without being affected but are still contagious. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. Salmonella enterica Typhi is believed to infect and replicate only within humans.Typhoid is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi growing in the intestines Peyer's patches mesenteric lymph nodes spleen liver gallbladder bone marrow and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include limited access to clean drinking water and poor sanitation. Those who have not yet been exposed to it and ingest contaminated drinking water or food are most at risk for developing symptoms. Only humans can be infected; there are no known animal reservoirs.  Salmonella Typhi which causes typhoid fever is different than the other Salmonella bacteria that usually cause salmonellosis a common type of food poisoning.Diagnosis is performed by culturing and identifying S. enterica typhi from patient samples or detecting an immune response to the pathogen from blood samples. Recently new advances in large-scale data collection and analysis have allowed researchers to develop better diagnostics such as detecting changing abundances of small molecules in the blood that may specifically indicate typhoid fever. Diagnostic tools in regions where typhoid is most prevalent are quite limited in their accuracy and specificity and the time required for a proper diagnosis the increasing spread of antibiotic resistance and the cost of testing are also hardships for under-resourced healthcare systems.A typhoid vaccine can prevent about 40% to 90% of cases during the first two years. The vaccine may have some effect for up to seven years. For those at high risk or people traveling to areas where it is common vaccination is recommended. Other efforts to prevent it include providing clean drinking water good sanitation and handwashing. Until an infection is confirmed as cleared the infected person should not prepare food for others. Typhoid is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins. Resistance to these antibiotics has been developing which has made treatment more difficult.In 2015 12.5 million new typhoid cases were reported. The disease is most common in India. Children are most commonly affected. Typhoid decreased in the developed world in the 1940s as a result of improved sanitation and the use of antibiotics. Every year about 400 cases are reported in the U.S. and an estimated 6000 people have typhoid. In 2015 it resulted in about 149000 deaths worldwide \u2013 down from 181000 in 1990. Without treatment the risk of death may be as high as 20%. With treatment it is between 1% and 4%.Typhus is a different disease caused by unrelated species of bacteria. Owing to their similar symptoms they were not recognized as distinct diseases until the 1800s. \"Typhoid\" means \"resembling typhus\"."

Traditionally these anamorphic (asexual or imperfect fungi) mold genera are: Microsporum Epidermophyton and Trichophyton. There are about 40 species in these three genera. Species capable of reproducing sexually belong in the teleomorphic genus Arthroderma of the Ascomycota (see Teleomorph anamorph and holomorph for more information on this type of fungal life cycle). As of 2019 a total of nine genera are identified and new phylogenetic taxonomy has been proposed.Dermatophytes cause infections of the skin hair and nails obtaining nutrients from keratinized material. The organisms colonize the keratin tissues causing inflammation as the host responds to metabolic byproducts. Colonies of dermatophytes are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate the viable tissue of an immunocompetent host. Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases (proteases) elastase keratinases and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. Additionally the products of these degradative enzymes serve as nutrients for the fungi. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure whereas the lack of or defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.Some of these skin infections are known as ringworm or tinea (which is the Latin word for \"worm\") though infections are not caused by worms. It is thought that the word tinea (worm) is used to describe the snake-like appearance of the dermatophyte on the skin. Toenail and fingernail infections are referred to as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes usually do not invade living tissues but colonize the outer layer of the skin. Occasionally the organisms do invade subcutaneous tissues resulting in kerion development."

These medications come as creams gels lotions ointments powders shampoos tinctures and sprays. Most antifungal drugs induce fungal cell death by destroying the cell wall of the fungus. These drugs inhibit the production of ergosterol which is a fundamental component of the fungal cell membrane and wall.Antifungal drugs are generally classified according to their chemical structures and their corresponding mechanism of actions. The four classes of topical antifungal drugs are azole antifungals polyene antifungals allylamine antifungals and other antifungals. Azole antifungals inhibit the enzyme that converts lanosterol into ergosterol. Common examples of azole antifungals include clotrimazole econazole ketoconazole miconazole and tioconazole. The only polyene antifungal available topically is nystatin which works by binding to ergosterol thus disrupting the integrity of the fungal cell membrane. Similar to azoles allylamines disrupt the fungal cell wall synthesis through inhibition of the squalene epoxidase enzyme that converts squalene into ergosterol. Examples of allylamines antifungals comprise amorolfin naftifine and terbinafine. The last group consists of antifungal drugs with a different mechanism of action than the other three classes. These drugs include benzoxaborole antifungals ciclopirox olamine antifungals thiocarbamate antifungals and undecylenic alkanolamide antifungals. Topical antifungal drugs may come with side effects such as itching and local irritation. They can also interact with food and different medications. Therefore topical antifungals should be used with caution and with advice from medical professionals."

There are three genera of fungi commonly implicated: Trichophyton (found in skin nail and hair infections) Epidermophyton (skin and nail infections) and Microsporum (skin and hair infections).Dermatophytes produce an infection commonly known as ringworm or tinea.  It can appear as \"jock itch\" in the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris); on the scalp and hair (tinea capitis) resulting in brittle hair shafts that fall out easily.  Tinea unguium affects the nails and athlete's foot (tinea pedis) affects the feet. Tinea versicolor refers to a fungal infection of the skin caused by Malassezia furfur. It appears anywhere on the skin and produces red or gray scaly patches of itchy skin. Deeper infections may be discoloured ulcerative and purulent.A Candida yeast infection can also be identified by a KOH test by taking scrapings from the mouth (oral thrush) vagina (vaginitis) and skin (candidiasis).

They often serve as a form of black self-expression. Cornrows are traditionally called \"kolese\" or \"irun didi\" in Yoruba and are often nicknamed \"didi braids\" in the Nigerian diaspora.Cornrows are worn by both sexes and are on some occasions adorned with beads hair cuffs or cowrie shells. The duration of weaving cornrow braids may take up to five hours depending on the quantity and width. Often favored for their easy maintenance cornrows can be left in for weeks at a time if maintained through careful washing of the hair and natural oiling of the scalp. Braids are considered a protective styling on African curly hair as they allow for easy and restorative growth; braids pulled too tightly or worn for longer lengths of time and on different hair types can cause a type of hair loss known as traction alopecia."

Hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft. The protein called keratin makes up hair and stimulates hair growth. Hair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen catagen and telogen. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair.The body has different types of hair including vellus hair and androgenic hair each with its own type of cellular construction.  This varied construction  gives the hair unique characteristics serving specific purposes mainly warmth (redundant in modern humans) and physical protection. Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating but many humans develop much longer hair."

It gets its name from its resemblance to the tail of a pony.Ponytails are most commonly gathered at the middle of the back of the head or the base of the neck but may also be worn at the side of the head  (sometimes considered formal) or on the very top of the head. If the hair is divided so that it hangs in two sections they are called ponytails twintails pigtails or bunches if left loose and pigtails plaits or braids if plaited."

        "article": "A protective hairstyle is a term predominantly used to describe hairstyles suitable for Afro-textured hair. These hairstyles are designed to minimize manipulation and exposure of the hair to environmental elements. Factors such as extreme temperatures humidity and precipitation can adversely affect hair health. Protective hairstyles are beneficial in mitigating these effects by keeping the hair tucked away and reducing its exposure to potentially damaging conditions.Common types of protective hairstyles include braids wigs locks and twists. These styles are not only functional in protecting the hair from weather-related damage but also aid in retaining hair length and promoting growth. The adoption of protective hairstyles can lead to a reduction in hair tangles and knots. Additionally these styles can offer respite to the hair from constant styling pulling and combing thus contributing to overall hair health.Protective hairstyles have also been recognized for their cultural and social significance. They play a role in the expression of cultural identity and can be seen as a form of artistic and personal expression. The versatility and diversity of these hairstyles reflect the rich cultural heritage associated with Afro-textured hair.Afro-textured hair is often prone to breakage or damage from the elements; protective hairstyles aim to guard against this. However protective hairstyles sometimes involve tension at the scalp like braids with weaves and wigs and can cause thinning of the hairline. They may also prevent hair from growing which if prolonged may lead to traction alopecia. This happens mainly in cases of untreated hair that is not properly maintained with the necessary oils and products.Protective styles require styling hair for a few days and using the correct styles and products. Depending on the hairstyle and how well it is taken care of protective hairstyles can last between two weeks to two months.In the United States some jurisdictions have banned discrimination based on hairstyles associated with African Americans including protective hairstyles. In 2007 a radio host Don Imus caused an outrage when he called the Rutgers University basketball team \"nappy-headed\". This led to cancellations of his future show. In 2020 Noah Cyrus made a comment about \"nappy hair\" which led to many controversies. She later on apologized through social media saying she didn't know the context and history behind the terms she had used. A federal bill called the Crown Act was passed in 2022: the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2022 was passed with the intention to prohibit race-based discrimination based on hairstyles and hair texture. In present time Black women have created blogs and YouTube channels to embrace their hairstyles in positive ways."

        "article": "A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that does not invade neighboring tissue or metastasize (spread throughout the body). Compared to malignant (cancerous) tumors benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate. Benign tumors have relatively well differentiated cells. They are often surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of connective tissue) or stay contained within the epithelium. Common examples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids.Some forms of benign tumors may be harmful to health. Benign tumor growth causes a mass effect that can compress neighboring tissues. This can lead to nerve damage blood flow reduction (ischemia) tissue death (necrosis) or organ damage. The health effects of benign tumor growth may be more prominent if the tumor is contained within an enclosed space such as the cranium respiratory tract sinus or bones. For example unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body benign brain tumors can be life-threatening. Tumors may exhibit behaviors characteristic of their cell type of origin; as an example endocrine tumors such as thyroid adenomas and adrenocortical adenomas may overproduce certain hormones.The word \"benign\" means \"favourable kind fortunate salutary propitious\". However a benign tumour is not benign in the usual sense; the name merely specifies that it is not \"malignant\" i.e. cancerous. While benign tumours usually do not pose a serious health risk they can be harmful or fatal. Many types of benign tumors have the potential to become cancerous (malignant) through a process known as tumor progression. For this reason and other possible harms some benign tumors are removed by surgery. When removed benign tumors usually do not return. Exceptions to this rule may indicate malignant transformation."

This immunologically distinct type of urticaria is considered autoimmune because the immune system which normally protects the body from foreign organisms mistakenly attacks the body's own cells causing inflammation and other symptoms.The condition is chronic meaning it persists for more than six weeks and can last for many years. Symptoms include recurrent episodes of hives which are red itchy and swollen areas on the skin. These episodes can be triggered by various factors including heat stress or for no identifiable reason.Autoimmune urticaria is a relatively rare condition affecting a small percentage of the population. However it can significantly impact the quality of life of those affected due to the unpredictability and discomfort of the symptoms. The exact cause of autoimmune urticaria is not fully understood but it is believed to involve a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.Diagnosis is typically based on the clinical history and physical examination and confirmed by laboratory tests. Treatment primarily involves managing symptoms and includes the use of antihistamines corticosteroids monoclonal antibodies (omalizumab) and in some cases immunosuppressive drugs.Despite ongoing research many aspects of autoimmune urticaria remain poorly understood and it continues to be a challenging condition to manage. The economic burden is significant with costs as high as $2050 per year per patient in the United States."

They are distinguished from cancerous tumors as they are caused by a viral infection such as a human papillomavirus  rather than a cancerous growth.Factors that increase the risk include the use of public showers and pools working with meat eczema and a weak immune system. The virus is believed to infect the host through the entrance of a skin wound. A number of types exist including plantar warts \"filiform warts\" and genital warts. Genital warts are often sexually transmitted.Without treatment most types of warts resolve in months to years. A number of treatments may speed resolution including salicylic acid applied to the skin and cryotherapy. In those who are otherwise healthy they do not typically result in significant problems. Treatment of genital warts differs from that of other types. Infection of a virus such as HIV can cause warts. This is prevented through careful handling of needles or sharp objects that could infect the individual through physical trauma of the skin plus the practice of safe sex and sexual abstinence. Viruses that are not sexually transmitted or are not transmitted in the case of a wart can be prevented through a number of behaviors such as wearing shoes outdoors and avoiding unsanitized areas without proper shoes or clothing such as public restrooms or locker rooms.Warts are very common with most people being infected at some point in their lives. The estimated current rate of non-genital warts among the general population is 1\u201313%. They are more common among young people. Prior to widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine the estimated rate of genital warts in sexually active women was 12%. Warts have been described as far back as 400 BC by Hippocrates."

Symptoms include a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over fever and swollen lymph nodes. The illness is usually mild and most of those infected will recover within a few weeks without treatment. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from five to twenty-one days and symptoms typically last from two to four weeks. Cases may be severe especially in children pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems.The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus a zoonotic virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus. The variola virus the causative agent of the disease smallpox is also in this genus. Human-to-human transmission can occur through direct contact with infected skin or body fluids including sexual contact. People remain infectious from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and healed. It may spread from infected animals by handling infected meat or via bites or scratches. Diagnosis can be confirmed by PCR testing a lesion for the virus' DNA.Vaccination is recommended for those at high risk of infection. Evidence shows that the MVA-BN vaccine is 86% effective at reducing the risk of mpox illness. The aim of treatment is to manage the symptoms and prevent complications as there is no specific treatment for the disease. Antiviral drugs such as tecovirimat can be used to treat mpox although their effectiveness has not been proved.Mpox is endemic in central and western Africa where several species of mammals are suspected to act as a natural reservoir of the virus. The first human cases were diagnosed in 1970 in Basankusu Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then the frequency and severity of outbreaks has significantly increased possibly as a result of waning immunity since the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. The 2022\u20132023 mpox outbreak represents the first incidence of widespread community transmission outside of Africa. This was initially identified in the United Kingdom in May 2022 with subsequent cases confirmed in 111 countries as of May 2023. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) between 23 July 2022 and 10 May 2023."

From the mid-1980s Jackson's appearance began to change dramatically. The changes to his face particularly his nose triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery and his skin tone became much lighter.Jackson was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo which results in white patches on the skin and sensitivity to sunlight. To treat the condition he used fair-colored makeup and likely skin-bleaching prescription creams to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin. The lighter skin resulted in criticism that he was trying to appear white. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not.Jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father Joe Jackson. In 2003 Joe admitted to whipping them as children but he emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health problems later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.At some point during the 1990s it appeared that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. Jackson gradually became dependent on these drugs and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993. While preparing for a series of comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009 Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25 2009. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison."

After being kicked out of his home as a teenager he traveled to Woodcrest where he worked 47 odd jobs. He embodies many old American working-class stereotypes as he is crude short-tempered obese clumsy rule-breaking and a jack of all trades. One of his most notable traits is his internalized racism; he is an outspoken white supremacist and even claims to be an Irish-American who suffers from \"reverse vitiligo\".Despite this Ruckus maintains a close relationship with Robert Freeman and yearns for social acceptance. Despite the blue-collar routine of his life he has had a number of remarkable experiences including work as a recording artist."

        "article": "The World Vitiligo Day observed on June 25 is an initiative aimed to build global awareness about vitiligo. Vitiligo occurs in 1-2% of the population worldwide; a change of color in the skin creating a variety of patterns on the skin from the loss of pigment. Vitiligo is often called a disease instead of a disorder and that can have a significant negative social and/or psychological impact on patients in part because of numerous misconceptions still present in large parts of the world.The idea of a World Vitiligo Day was first nursed by Steve Haragadon the founder of the Vitiligo Friends network and then developed and finalized by Ogo Maduewesi a Nigerian vitiligo patient who is the founder and Executive Director of the Vitiligo Support and Awareness Foundation (VITSAF). In her words \u201cWorld Vitiligo Day is a day to create extensive awareness on vitiligo and a day dedicated to all living with vitiligo globally\u201d.The first World Vitiligo Day (also defined as \u201cVitiligo Awareness Day\u201d or \u201cVitiligo Purple Fun day\u201d from the color chosen as Vitiligo Awareness Color) was observed on June 25 2011. The choice of June 25 as World Vitiligo Day is a memorial to musical artist Michael Jackson who suffered from vitiligo from the early 1980s until his death which occurred on June 25 2009. The main event of the first World Vitiligo Day occurred at Silverbird Galleria's Artrum in Lagos Nigeria with the participation of several volunteers with different experiences (dermatologists motivational speakers dancers artists comedians patients) united by the common will of spreading knowledge and awareness about vitiligo. Simultaneously other events took place in other parts of the world organized by local associations.In 2012 Vitiligo Research Foundation (VRF) a non-profit organization aiming to fund and fast-track medical research as well as connect investigators care providers patients and philanthropists to accelerate vitiligo research and relieve the suffering of patients registered the Web domain name 25june.org and joined VITSAF and cooperating organizations to increase the efficacy of their efforts in favor of global vitiligo awareness. A goal of the World Vitiligo Day 2012 was to raise 500000 signatures to address the United Nations in order to:recognize this disease associated with severe social complications;recognize the desire to pursue multilateral efforts in therapy development and health-care education;designate June 25 as the World Vitiligo Day to be observed by the United Nations and Member States every year."

        "article": "Asperger syndrome (AS) also known as Asperger's syndrome formerly described a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior interests and activities. The syndrome has been merged with other disorders into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is no longer considered a stand-alone diagnosis. It was considered milder than other diagnoses which were merged into ASD due to relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.The syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who in 1944 described children in his care who struggled to form friendships did not understand others' gestures or feelings engaged in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests and were clumsy. In 1994 the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013 the syndrome was removed and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.The exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that 'treatment' of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not 'a disease that can be removed or cured'. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists while co-occurring conditions might require treatment 'management of autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world'. The effectiveness of particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data. Interventions may include social skills training cognitive behavioral therapy physical therapy speech therapy parent training and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less obvious in adulthood but social and communication difficulties usually persist.In 2015 Asperger's was estimated to affect 37.2 million people globally or about 0.5% of the population. The exact percentage of people affected has still not been firmly established. Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in males more often than females and females are typically diagnosed at a later age. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went through a period of popularization. It became a standardized diagnosis in the 1990s and was merged into ASD in 2013. Many questions and controversies about the condition remain."

        "article": "Down syndrome or Down's syndrome also known as trisomy 21 is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is usually associated with developmental delays mild to moderate intellectual disability and characteristic physical features. There are three types of Down syndrome the most common being Trisomy 21. Mosaic Down syndrome accounts for two per cent of Down syndrome cases and Translocation Down syndrome accounts for three per cent of cases.The parents of the affected individual are usually genetically normal. The probability increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those of age 45. The extra chromosome is provided at conception as the egg and sperm combine. A very small percentage of 1-2% gets the additional chromosome in the embryo stage and it only impacts some of the cells in the body; this is known as Mosaic Down syndrome. Usually babies get 23 chromosomes from each parent for a total of 46 whereas in Down syndrome a third 21st chromosome is attached. It is believed to occur by chance with no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the probability. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. Since the introduction of screening Down syndrome pregnancies are often aborted (rates varying from 50 to 85% depending on maternal age gestational age and maternal race/ethnicity).There is no cure for Down syndrome. Education and proper care have been shown to provide good quality of life. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical school classes while others require more specialized education. Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school and a few attend post-secondary education. In adulthood about 20% in the United States do paid work in some capacity with many requiring a sheltered work environment. Support in financial and legal matters is often needed. Life expectancy is around 50 to 60\u00a0years in the developed world with proper health care. Regular screening for health issues common in Down syndrome is recommended throughout the person's life.Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality. It occurs in about 1 in 1000 babies born each year. In the US this figure is given as one in 700 births. In 2015 Down syndrome was present in 5.4 million individuals globally and resulted in 27000 deaths down from 43000 deaths in 1990. It is named after British physician John Langdon Down who fully described the syndrome in 1866. Some aspects of the condition were described earlier by French psychiatrist Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol in 1838 and French physician \u00c9douard S\u00e9guin in 1844. The genetic cause of Down syndrome was discovered in 1959."

        "article": "Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of 13 genetic connective-tissue disorders. Symptoms often include loose joints joint pain stretchy velvety skin and abnormal scar formation. These may be noticed at birth or in early childhood. Complications may include aortic dissection joint dislocations scoliosis chronic pain or early osteoarthritis. The current classification was last updated in 2017 when a number of rarer forms of EDS were added.EDS occurs due to variations of more than 19 genes that are present at birth. The specific gene affected determines the type of EDS though the genetic causes of hypermobile Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (hEDS) are still unknown. Some cases result from a new variation occurring during early development while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner. Typically these variations result in defects in the structure or processing of the protein collagen or tenascin.Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing or skin biopsy particularly with hEDS but people may initially be misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis depression or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Genetic testing can be used to confirm all other types of EDS.A cure is not yet known and treatment is supportive in nature. Physical therapy and bracing may help strengthen muscles and support joints. Some forms of EDS result in a normal life expectancy but those that affect blood vessels generally decrease it. All forms of EDS can result in fatal outcomes for some patients.While hEDS affects at least one in 5000 people globally other types occur at lower frequencies. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder. Excess mobility was first described by Hippocrates in 400 BC. The syndromes are named after two physicians Edvard Ehlers and Henri-Alexandre Danlos who described them at the turn of the 20th century."

Klinefelter syndrome occurs randomly. The extra X chromosome comes from the father and mother nearly equally. An older mother may have a slightly increased risk of a child with KS.

        "article": "Stockholm syndrome is a proposed condition or theory that tries to explain why hostages sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors. It is supposed to result from a rather specific set of circumstances namely the power imbalances contained in hostage-taking kidnapping and abusive relationships. Therefore it is difficult to find a large number of people who experience Stockholm syndrome to conduct studies with any sort of validity or useful sample size. This makes it hard to determine trends in the development and effects of the condition and in fact it is a \"contested illness\" due to doubts about the legitimacy of the condition. Emotional bonds can possibly form between captors and captives during intimate time together but these are considered irrational by some in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) the standard tool for diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses and disorders in the United States mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research. The syndrome is rare: according to data from the FBI about 8% of hostage victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.Stockholm syndrome is paradoxical because the sympathetic sentiments that captives feel towards their captors are the opposite of the fear and disdain which an onlooker might feel towards the captors.There are four key components that characterize Stockholm syndrome:A hostage's development of positive feelings towards the captorNo previous relationship between hostage and captorA refusal by hostages to cooperate with police and other government authoritiesA hostage's belief in the humanity of the captor ceasing to perceive them as a threat when the victim holds the same values as the aggressor."

L. Barrett sample and Metro Boomin\u2019s producer tag placement in \"Pt. 1\" and West's verse on \"Pt. 2\". The former was listed among the best songs of 2016 by multiple publications including Complex and HipHopDX. It was an Award-Winning R&amp;B/Hip-Hop and Rap Song at the 2017 ASCAP Rhythm &amp; Soul Music Awards and was among the 35 Most Performed R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs at the 2017 BMI R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Awards. Both parts of the song charted in the United States the United Kingdom Sweden the Netherlands Ireland and Canada in 2016. \"Pt. 1\" and \"Pt. 2\" have since been certified sextuple platinum and platinum respectively by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States while both respective parts have been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in the United Kingdom.A reinterpretation of \"Pt. 1\" produced by West was released under the title of \"Father Stretch\" on Sunday Service Choir's debut studio album Jesus Is Born (2019). It lacks sexually explicit lyrics and includes more elements of the gospel than the original. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. The majority of them commented on the song's development of the original while some critics noted its appeal to certain audiences.

The Seven Sisters cliffs run between the mouth of the River Cuckmere near Seaford and the chalk headland of Beachy Head outside of Eastbourne. The dips or swales that separate each of the seven crests from the next are the remnants of dry valleys in the chalk South Downs which are being gradually eroded by the sea.Some of the cliffs and adjacent countryside make up the Seven Sisters Country Park which is bounded on its inland side by the A259 road and is itself a part of the larger South Downs National Park."

Founded on September 13 1921 in Wichita Kansas it has been generally credited as the world's first fast-food hamburger chain. It is known for its small square hamburgers referred to as \"sliders\". The burgers were initially priced at five cents until 1929 and remained at 10 cents until 1949. In the 1940s White Castle periodically ran promotional ads in local newspapers which contained coupons offering five burgers for ten cents takeout only. In 2014 Time named the White Castle slider \"The Most Influential Burger of All Time\"."

The term hyperlipidemia refers to the laboratory finding itself and is also used as an umbrella term covering any of various acquired or genetic disorders that result in that finding. Hyperlipidemia represents a subset of dyslipidemia and a superset of hypercholesterolemia. Hyperlipidemia is usually chronic and requires ongoing  medication to control blood lipid levels.Lipids (water-insoluble molecules) are transported in a protein capsule. The size of that capsule or lipoprotein determines its density. The lipoprotein density and type of apolipoproteins it contains determines the fate of the particle and its influence on metabolism.Hyperlipidemias are divided into primary and secondary subtypes. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to genetic causes (such as a mutation in a receptor protein) while secondary hyperlipidemia arises due to other underlying causes such as diabetes. Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are common in the general population and are regarded as modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease due to their influence on atherosclerosis. In addition some forms may predispose to acute pancreatitis."

The term progeroid syndrome does not necessarily imply progeria (Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria syndrome) which is a specific type of progeroid syndrome.Progeroid means \"resembling premature aging\" a definition that can apply to a broad range of diseases. Familial Alzheimer's disease and familial Parkinson's disease are two well-known accelerated-aging diseases that are more frequent in older individuals. They affect only one tissue and can be classified as unimodal progeroid syndromes. Segmental progeria which is more frequently associated with the term progeroid syndrome tends to affect multiple or all tissues while causing affected individuals to exhibit only some of the features associated with aging.All disorders within this group are thought to be monogenic meaning they arise from mutations of a single gene. Most known PS are due to genetic mutations that lead to either defects in the DNA repair mechanism or defects in lamin A/C.Examples of PS include Werner syndrome (WS) Bloom syndrome (BS) Rothmund\u2013Thomson syndrome (RTS) Cockayne syndrome (CS) xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) trichothiodystrophy (TTD) combined xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS) restrictive dermopathy (RD) and Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Individuals with these disorders tend to have a reduced lifespan. Progeroid syndromes have been widely studied in the fields of aging regeneration stem cells and cancer. The most widely studied of the progeroid syndromes are Werner syndrome and Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria as they are seen to most resemble natural aging."

This is the opposite use of a hygroscopic material where it is used as a desiccant used to draw moisture away.In pharmaceuticals and cosmetics humectants can be used in topical dosage forms to increase the solubility of a chemical compound's active ingredients increasing the active ingredients' ability to penetrate skin or its activity time. This hydrating property can also be needed to counteract a dehydrating active ingredient (e.g. soaps corticoids and some alcohols) which is why humectants are common ingredients in a wide range of cosmetic and personal care products that make moisturization claims (e.g. hair conditioners body lotions face or body cleansers lip balms and eye creams)."

It may be caused by vitamin A deficiency which is sometimes used to describe that condition although there may be other causes.Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry thick and wrinkled. The first symptom is poor vision at night. If untreated xerophthalmia can lead to dry eye syndrome corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal and retinal damage.Xerophthalmia usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency\u2014a rare condition in developed countries but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging poor lid closure scarring from a previous injury or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia often transiently although in some patients late onset or persistent xerophthalmia has been observed.The damage to the cornea in vitamin A associated xerophthalmia is quite different from damage to the retina at the back of the globe a type of damage which can also be due to lack of vitamin A but which is caused by lack of other forms of vitamin A which work in the visual system. Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid since (along with certain growth-stunting effects) the condition can be reversed in vitamin A deficient rats by retinoic acid supplementation (however the retinal damage continues). Since retinoic acid cannot be reduced to retinal or retinol these effects on the cornea must be specific to retinoic acid. This is in keeping with retinoic acid's known requirement for good health in epithelial cells such as those in the cornea."

        "article": "Zinc is a chemical element; it has symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects it is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2) and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende) a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia Asia and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore roasting and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).Zinc is an essential trace element for humans animals plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. It is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth as it is an important cofactor for many enzymes.Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children deficiency causes growth retardation delayed sexual maturation infection susceptibility and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia lethargy and copper deficiency. In marine biomes notably within polar regions a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.Brass an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kalmykia Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India Uzbekistan Iran Syria Iraq and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To date the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar in Rajasthan as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher's wool\" or \"white snow\".The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries small non-structural castings and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements) zinc chloride (in deodorants) zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos) zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints) and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory."

The story confronts Zits' feelings of vulnerability as a misunderstood teenager an orphan and as a biracial person with Native American ancestry and how forgiveness across multiple generations is an inside job."

It was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense\u2014as well as eclectic Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies\u2014as a new school of martial arts thought.The core of Jeet Kune Do is the interception of the opponent making corresponding responses or counterattacks that strike at incoming attacks. JKD also incorporates a set of principles to help practitioners make instant decisions and improve the physical and mental self being intended to have practical applications in life without the traditional routines and metaphysics of conventional martial arts. As an eclectic martial art it relies on a fighting style heavily influenced by Wing Chun Tai Chi taekwondo boxing fencing and jujutsu.Bruce Lee himself never formalized Jeet Kune Do before he died. This forced later JKD practitioners to rely upon their own interpretation of the philosophy created by Bruce Lee."

It borders the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Maine to its east Connecticut and Rhode Island to its south New Hampshire and Vermont to its north and New York to its west. Massachusetts is the sixth-smallest state by land area. With over seven million residents as of 2020 it is the most populous state in New England the 16th-most-populous in the country and the third-most densely populated after New Jersey and Rhode Island.Massachusetts was a site of early English colonization. The Plymouth Colony was founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims of the Mayflower. In 1630 the Massachusetts Bay Colony taking its name from the Indigenous Massachusett people also established settlements in Boston and Salem. In 1692 the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria the Salem witch trials. In the late 18th century Boston became known as the \"Cradle of Liberty\" for the agitation there that later led to the American Revolution. In 1786 Shays' Rebellion a populist revolt led by disaffected American Revolutionary War veterans influenced the United States Constitutional Convention. Originally dependent on agriculture fishing and trade Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. Before the American Civil War the state was a center for the abolitionist temperance and transcendentalist movements.  During the 20th century the state's economy shifted from manufacturing to services; and in the 21st century Massachusetts has become the global leader in biotechnology and also excels in artificial intelligence engineering higher education finance and maritime trade.The state's capital and most populous city as well as its cultural and financial center is Boston. Other major cities are Worcester Springfield and Cambridge. Massachusetts is also home to the urban core of Greater Boston the largest metropolitan area in New England and a region profoundly influential upon American history academia and the research economy. Massachusetts has a reputation for social and political progressivism; becoming the only U.S. state with a right to shelter law and the first U.S. state and one of the earliest jurisdictions in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriage. Boston is considered a hub of LGBT culture and activism in the United States. Harvard University in Cambridge is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States with the largest financial endowment of any university in the world. Both Harvard and MIT also in Cambridge are perennially ranked as either the most or among the most highly regarded academic institutions in the world. Massachusetts's public-school students place among the top tier in the world in academic performance.Massachusetts is the most educated and one of the most highly developed and wealthiest U.S. states ranking first in the percentage of population 25 and over with either a bachelor's degree or advanced degree first on both the American Human Development Index and the standard Human Development Index first in per capita income and as of 2023 first in median income. Consequently Massachusetts typically ranks as the top U.S. state as well as the most expensive state for residents to live in."

It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis or COVID-19 or those who are immunocompromized such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely it can affect skin.Aspergillosis occurs in humans birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct. Most cases of acute aspergillosis occur in people with severely compromised immune systems such as those undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Chronic colonization or infection can cause complications in people with underlying respiratory illnesses such as asthma cystic fibrosis sarcoidosis tuberculosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most commonly aspergillosis occurs in the form of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) aspergilloma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Some forms are intertwined; for example ABPA and simple aspergilloma can progress to CPA.Other noninvasive manifestations include fungal sinusitis (both allergic in nature and with established fungal balls) otomycosis (ear infection) keratitis (eye infection) and onychomycosis (nail infection). In most instances these are less severe and curable with effective antifungal treatment.The most frequently identified pathogens are Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus ubiquitous organisms capable of living under extensive environmental stress. Most people are thought to inhale thousands of Aspergillus spores daily but without effect due to an efficient immune response. Invasive aspergillosis has a 20% mortality at 6 months. The major chronic invasive and allergic forms of aspergillosis account for around 600000 deaths annually worldwide."

His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases which laid down the foundations of hygiene public health and much of modern medicine. Pasteur's works are credited with saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honored as the \"father of bacteriology\" and the \"father of microbiology\" (together with Robert Koch; the latter epithet also attributed to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek).Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences his experiment demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed; conversely in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow. For this experiment the academy awarded him the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2500 francs in 1862.Pasteur is also regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory of diseases which was a minor medical concept at the time. His many experiments showed that diseases could be prevented by killing or stopping germs thereby directly supporting the germ theory and its application in clinical medicine. He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination a process now called pasteurization. Pasteur also made significant discoveries in chemistry most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization. Early in his career his investigation of sodium ammonium tartrate initiated the field of optical isomerism. This work had a profound effect on structural chemistry with eventual implications for many areas including medicinal chemistry.He was the director of the Pasteur Institute established in 1887 until his death and his body was interred in a vault beneath the institute. Although Pasteur made groundbreaking experiments his reputation became associated with various controversies. Historical reassessment of his notebook revealed that he practiced deception to overcome his rivals."

        "article": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) also known as flesh-eating disease is a bacterial infection that results in the death of parts of the body's soft tissue. It is a severe disease of sudden onset that spreads rapidly. Symptoms usually include red or purple skin in the affected area severe pain fever and vomiting. The most commonly affected areas are the limbs and perineum.Typically the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. Risk factors include poor immune function such as from diabetes or cancer obesity alcoholism intravenous drug use and peripheral artery disease. It does not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Medical imaging is often helpful to confirm the diagnosis.Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. It is usually treated with surgery to remove the infected tissue and intravenous antibiotics. Often a combination of antibiotics is used such as penicillin G clindamycin IV vancomycin and gentamicin. Delays in surgery are associated with a much higher risk of death. Despite high-quality treatment the risk of death is between 25 and 35%.Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100000 per year in the U.S. and about 1 per 100000 in Western Europe. Both sexes are affected equally. It becomes more common among older people and is rare in children. It has been described at least since the time of Hippocrates. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952."

        "article": "Scarlet fever also known as scarlatina is an infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pyogenes a Group A streptococcus (GAS). It most commonly affects children between five and 15 years of age. The signs and symptoms include a sore throat fever headache swollen lymph nodes and a characteristic rash. The face is flushed and the rash is red and blanching. It typically feels like sandpaper and the tongue may be red and bumpy. The rash occurs as a result of capillary damage by exotoxins produced by S.pyogenes. On darker-pigmented skin the rash may be hard to discern.Scarlet fever develops in a small number of people who have strep throat or streptococcal skin infections. The bacteria are usually spread by people coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread when a person touches an object that has the bacteria on it and then touches their mouth or nose. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by culturing swabs of the throat.There is no vaccine for scarlet fever. Prevention is by frequent handwashing not sharing personal items and staying away from other people when sick. The disease is treatable with antibiotics which reduce symptoms and spread and prevent most complications. Outcomes with scarlet fever are typically good if treated. Long-term complications as a result of scarlet fever include kidney disease rheumatic fever and arthritis. In the early 20th century it was a leading cause of death in children but even before the Second World War and the introduction of antibiotics its severity was already declining perhaps due to better living conditions the introduction of better control measures or a decline in the virulence of the bacteria. In recent years there have been signs of antibiotic resistance; there was an outbreak in Hong Kong in 2011 and in the UK in 2014 and occurrence of the disease rose by 68% in the UK between 2014 and 2018. Research published in October 2020 showed that infection of the bacterium by three viruses has led to more virulent strains of the bacterium."

Some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity e.g. the anticonvulsant sultiame. The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based upon the antibacterial sulfonamides.Allergies to sulfonamides are common. The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3% close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully.Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine."

        "article": "Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Infection typically occurs by contact with the skin inhalation or intestinal absorption. Symptom onset occurs between one day and more than two months after the infection is contracted. The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center. The inhalation form presents with fever chest pain and shortness of breath. The intestinal form presents with diarrhea (which may contain blood) abdominal pains nausea and vomiting.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States the first clinical descriptions of cutaneous anthrax were given by Maret in 1752 and Fournier in 1769. Before that anthrax had been described only through historical accounts. The Prussian scientist Robert Koch (1843\u20131910) was the first to identify Bacillus anthracis as the bacterium that causes anthrax.Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacterium's spores which often appear in infectious animal products. Contact is by breathing or eating or through an area of broken skin. It does not typically spread directly between people. Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products and military personnel. Diagnosis can be confirmed by finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site.Anthrax vaccination is recommended for people at high risk of infection. Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. A two-month course of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin levofloxacin and doxycycline after exposure can also prevent infection. If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin. The type and number of antibiotics used depend on the type of infection. Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection.A rare disease human anthrax is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia. It also occurs more regularly in Southern Europe than elsewhere on the continent and is uncommon in Northern Europe and North America. Globally at least 2000 cases occur a year with about two cases a year in the United States. Skin infections represent more than 95% of cases. Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 23.7%. For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 to 75% while respiratory anthrax has a mortality of 50 to 80% even with treatment. Until the 20th century anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and animals each year. In herbivorous animals infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing. Animals may become infected by killing and/or eating infected animals.Anthrax has been developed as a weapon by a number of countries. Anthrax has been used in biowarfare and bioterrorism since 1914. However in 1975 the Biological Weapons Convention prohibited the \"development production and stockpiling\" of biological weapons. It has since been used in bioterrorism. Likely delivery methods of weaponized anthrax include aerial dispersal or dispersal through livestock; notable bioterrorism uses include the 2001 anthrax attacks and an incident in 1993 by the Aum Shinrikyo group in Japan."

Solenopsis are stinging ants and most of their common names reflect this for example ginger ants and tropical fire ants. Many of the names shared by this genus are often used interchangeably to refer to other species of ant such as the term red ant mostly because of their similar coloration despite not being in the genus Solenopsis. Both Myrmica rubra and Pogonomyrmex barbatus are common examples of non-Solenopsis ants being termed red ants.None of these names apply to all species of Solenopsis nor only to Solenopsis species; for example the colloquial names for several species of weaver ants in the genus Oecophylla in Southeast Asia include \"fire ants\" because of their similar coloration and painful bites; the two genera however are not closely related. Wasmannia auropunctata is another unrelated ant commonly called the \"little fire ant\" due to its potent sting."

It is usually used in conjunction with a flow of an inert gas that is lighter or less dense than air like helium or nitrogen. Continuing to breathe expels carbon dioxide and this prevents the panic sense of suffocation and struggling before unconsciousness known as the hypercapnic alarm response:\u200a45\u200a caused by the presence of high carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood. This method also makes the direct cause of death difficult to trace if the bag and gas canister are removed before the death is investigated. While asphyxiation by helium can be detected at autopsy there is currently no test that can detect asphyxiation by nitrogen. For this reason nitrogen is commonly the preferred choice for people who do not want the cause of death established.Suicide bags were first used during the 1990s.  The method was mainly developed in North America."

Not a single tree to be seen but there are low brushes with red berries which are very good eating. Here are bullocks horses and pigs that run wild rabbits wild geese and ducks and most excellent snipe shooting on the marshy ground and long grass of which the island in general has very little else. Likewise there is the tea plant which bears very sweet berry and wild thyme which we used as tea and is very good and much more plentiful than the former.This plant is cultivated in temperate regions and is suitable for rockeries or alpine gardens. The species and the hybrid cultivar 'Ione Hecker' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit."

        "article": "Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Early symptoms of deficiency include weakness fatigue and sore arms and legs. Without treatment decreased red blood cells gum disease changes to hair and bleeding from the skin may occur. As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing personality changes and finally death from infection or bleeding.It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C in the diet before symptoms occur. In modern times scurvy occurs most commonly in people with mental disorders unusual eating habits alcoholism and older people who live alone. Other risk factors include intestinal malabsorption and dialysis. While many animals produce their own vitamin C humans and a few others do not. Vitamin C an antioxidant is required to make the building blocks for collagen carnitine and catecholamines and assists the intestines in the absorption of iron from foods.  Diagnosis is typically based on outward appearance X-rays and improvement after treatment.Treatment is with vitamin C supplements taken by mouth. Improvement often begins in a few days with complete recovery in a few weeks. Sources of vitamin C in the diet include citrus fruit and a number of vegetables including red peppers broccoli and tomatoes. Cooking often decreases the residual amount of vitamin C in foods.Scurvy is rare compared to other nutritional deficiencies. It occurs more often in the developing world in association with malnutrition. Rates among refugees are reported at 5 to 45 percent. Scurvy was described as early as the time of ancient Egypt. It was a limiting factor in long-distance sea travel often killing large numbers of people. During the Age of Sail it was assumed that 50 percent of the sailors would die of scurvy on a major trip. A Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy James Lind is generally credited with proving that scurvy can be successfully treated with citrus fruit in 1753. Nevertheless it was not until 1795 that health reformers such as Gilbert Blane persuaded the Royal Navy to routinely give lemon juice to its sailors.However the Spanish already knew about the use of citrus fruits as a remedy since the second half of the 16th century more than 100 years before the birth of James Lind thanks to the treatise by Fray Agust\u00edn Farf\u00e1n in 1579 under the title Tratado breve de anatom\u00eda y cirug\u00eda y de algunas enfermedades where the use of oranges and lemons is recommended for the treatment of scurvy."

        "article": "Vitamins are organic molecules (or a set of closely related molecules called vitamers) that are essential to an organism in small quantities for proper metabolic function. Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism in sufficient quantities for survival and therefore must be obtained through the diet. For example vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others; it is not considered a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second.  Most vitamins are not single molecules but groups of related molecules called vitamers. For example there are eight vitamers of vitamin E: four tocopherols and four tocotrienols.The term vitamin does not include the three other groups of essential nutrients: minerals essential fatty acids and essential amino acids.Major health organizations list thirteen vitamins:Vitamin A (all-trans-retinols all-trans-retinyl-esters as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids)Vitamin B1 (thiamine)Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)Vitamin B3 (niacin)Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)Vitamin B7 (biotin)Vitamin B9 (folic acid and folates)Vitamin B12 (cobalamins)Vitamin C (ascorbic acid and ascorbates)Vitamin D (calciferols)Vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols)Vitamin K (phylloquinones menaquinones and menadiones)Some sources include a fourteenth choline.Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions. Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation. Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs. The B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them. Vitamins C and E function as antioxidants. Both deficient and excess intake of a vitamin can potentially cause clinically significant illness although excess intake of water-soluble vitamins is less likely to do so.All the vitamins were discovered between 1913 and 1948. Historically when intake of vitamins from diet was lacking the results were vitamin deficiency diseases. Then starting in 1935 commercially produced tablets of yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C became available. This was followed in the 1950s by the mass production and marketing of vitamin supplements including multivitamins to prevent vitamin deficiencies in the general population. Governments have mandated the addition of some vitamins to staple foods such as flour or milk referred to as food fortification to prevent deficiencies. Recommendations for folic acid supplementation during pregnancy reduced risk of infant neural tube defects."

It is also a generic prescription medication and in some countries is sold as a non-prescription dietary supplement. As a therapy it is used to prevent and treat scurvy a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency.Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue the formation of collagen and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function. It also functions as an antioxidant. Vitamin C may be taken by mouth or by intramuscular subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Various health claims exist on the basis that moderate vitamin C deficiency increases disease risk such as for the common cold cancer or COVID-19. There are also claims of benefits from vitamin C supplementation in excess of the recommended dietary intake for people who are not considered vitamin C deficient. Vitamin C is generally well-tolerated. Large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort headache trouble sleeping and flushing of the skin. The United States Institute of Medicine recommends against consuming large amounts.:\u200a155\u2013165\u200aMost animals are able to synthesize their own vitamin C. However apes (including humans) and monkeys (but not all primates) most bats most fish some rodents and certain other animals must acquire it from dietary sources because a gene for a synthesis enzyme has mutations that render it dysfunctional.Vitamin C was discovered in 1912 isolated in 1928 and in 1933 was the first vitamin to be chemically produced. Partly for its discovery Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine."

Other causes of hypercalcemia include sarcoidosis tuberculosis Paget disease multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) vitamin D toxicity familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia and certain medications such as lithium and hydrochlorothiazide. Diagnosis should generally include either a corrected calcium or ionized calcium level and be confirmed after a week. Specific changes such as a shortened QT interval and prolonged PR interval may be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG).Treatment may include intravenous fluids furosemide calcitonin intravenous bisphosphonate in addition to treating the underlying cause. The evidence for furosemide use however is poor. In those with very high levels hospitalization may be required. Haemodialysis may be used in those who do not respond to other treatments. In those with vitamin D toxicity steroids may be useful. Hypercalcemia is relatively common.

        "article": "Paget's disease of bone (commonly known as Paget's disease or historically osteitis deformans) is a condition involving cellular remodeling and deformity of one or more bones. The affected bones show signs of dysregulated bone remodeling at the microscopic level specifically excessive bone breakdown and subsequent disorganized new bone formation. These structural changes cause the bone to weaken which may result in deformity pain fracture or arthritis of associated joints.The exact cause is unknown although leading theories indicate both genetic and acquired factors (see Causes). Paget's disease may affect any one or several bones of the body (most commonly pelvis tibia femur lumbar vertebrae and skull) but never the entire skeleton and does not spread from bone to bone. Rarely a bone affected by Paget's disease can transform into a malignant bone cancer.As the disease often affects people differently treatments of Paget's disease can vary. Although there is no cure for Paget's disease medications (bisphosphonates and calcitonin) can help control the disorder and lessen pain and other symptoms. Medications are often successful in controlling the disorder especially when started before complications begin.Paget's disease affects from 1.5 to 8.0 percent of the population and is most common in those of British descent. It is primarily diagnosed in older people and is rare in people less than 55 years of age. Men are more commonly affected than women (3:2). The disease is named after English surgeon Sir James Paget who described it in 1877."

        "article": "The Ugly Duchess (also known as A Grotesque Old Woman) is a satirical portrait painted by the Flemish artist Quentin Matsys around 1513.The painting is in oil on an oak panel measuring 62.4 by 45.5\u00a0cm. It shows an old woman with wrinkled skin and withered breasts. She wears the aristocratic horned headdress (escoffion) of her youth out of fashion by the time  of the painting and holds  in her right hand a red flower then a symbol of engagement indicating that she is trying to attract a suitor. However it has been described as a bud that will 'likely never blossom'. The work is Matsys' best-known painting.The painting was long thought to have been derived from a putative lost work by Leonardo da Vinci on the basis of its striking resemblance to two caricature drawings of heads commonly attributed to the Italian artist. However the caricatures are now thought to be based on the work of Matsys who is known to have exchanged drawings with Leonardo.A possible literary influence is Erasmus's essay In Praise of Folly (1511) which satirizes women who \"still play the coquette\" \"cannot tear themselves away from their mirrors\" and \"do not hesitate to exhibit their repulsive withered breasts\". The woman has been often identified as Margaret Countess of Tyrol claimed by her enemies to be ugly; however she had died 150 years earlier.The painting is in the collection of the National Gallery in London to which it was bequeathed by Jenny Louisa Roberta Blaker in 1947. It was originally half of a diptych with a Portrait of an Old Man in the Mus\u00e9e Jacquemart-Andr\u00e9 Paris which was lent to the National Gallery in 2008 for an exhibition in which the two paintings were hung side by side.The portrait is thought to be a source for John Tenniel's 1865 illustrations of the Duchess in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.A 1989 article published in the British Medical Journal speculated that the subject might have suffered from Paget's disease in which the victim's bones enlarge and become deformed. A similar suggestion was made by Michael Baum emeritus professor of surgery at University College London."

When a blood vessel (a vein or an artery) is injured the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss.  Even when a blood vessel is not injured blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot or a piece of the clot that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.Thrombosis may occur in veins (venous thrombosis) or in arteries (arterial thrombosis). Venous thrombosis (sometimes called DVT deep vein thrombosis) leads to a blood clot in the affected part of the body while arterial thrombosis (and rarely severe venous thrombosis) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemia and necrosis). A piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus which could then travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as an embolism. This type of embolism is known as a thromboembolism. Complications can arise when a venous thromboembolism (commonly called a VTE) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism. An arterial embolus may travel further down the affected blood vessel where it can lodge as an embolism."

It can also be used as a supportive bandage for sprains and strains of the foot ankle and lower leg.  The gauze is impregnated with a thick creamy mixture of zinc oxide and calamine to promote healing.  It may also contain acacia glycerin castor oil and white petrolatum.The Unna\u2019s boot was named after German dermatologist Paul Gerson Unna.The Unna\u2019s Boot itself is a compression dressing usually made of cotton that contains zinc oxide paste. The zinc oxide paste in the Unna\u2019s Boot helps ease skin irritation and keeps the area moist. The zinc promotes healing within wound sites making it useful for burns and ulcers. Zinc oxide paste is superior to gelatins used in other dressings because it does not harden or cake. Some Unna Boots also contain calamine lotion and glycerin.For venous stasis ulcers the paste-impregnated wrap is covered by an elastic layer generally an elastic wrap (\"ACE\" bandage) or self-adherent elastic bandage such as Coban; this is referred to as a 2-layer compression bandage.  An alternative treatment is a 4-layer graduated compression wrap (Pro-Fore is an example).

The conditions of DVT only DVT with PE and PE only are all captured by the term venous thromboembolism (VTE).The initial treatment for VTE is typically either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin or increasingly with direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC). Those initially treated with heparins can be switched to other anticoagulants (warfarin DOACs) although pregnant women and some people with cancer receive ongoing heparin treatment. Superficial venous thrombosis or phlebitis affects the superficial veins of the upper or lower extremity and only require anticoagulation in specific situations and may be treated with anti-inflammatory pain relief only.There are other less common forms of venous thrombosis some of which can also lead to pulmonary embolism. Venous thromboembolism and superficial vein thrombosis account for about 90% of venous thrombosis.

        "article": "Rickettsia rickettsii is a Gram-negative intracellular coccobacillus bacterium that was first discovered in 1902. Having a reduced genome the bacterium harvests nutrients from its host cell to carry out respiration making it an organoheterotroph. Maintenance of its genome is carried out through vertical gene transfer where specialization of the bacterium allows it to shuttle host sugars directly into its TCA cycle. Other characteristics of the bacteria include membrane proteins that are useful in the identification of R. rickettsii strains and useful in the targeting of antibiotics. A capsule encircling the bacterium allows for attachment to host cells and additionally acts as a defense mechanism for resisting phagocytosis. Varying strains of R. rickettsii have different genotypes and phenotypes that alter the pathogenicity virulence and appearance of the bacteria.R. rickettsii is the causative agent of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and is transferred to its host via a tick bite. It is one of the most pathogenic Rickettsia species and affects a large majority of the Western Hemisphere most commonly the Americas. The pathogenic agent has been found on every continent except Antarctica; however Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever occurs mostly in North Central and South America. This prevalence is due to R. rickettsi thriving in warm damp environments. These environments provide sufficient conditions for the amplification of the bacteria within a vertebrate host such as a horse or dog. The bacteria are transmitted through the vector a tick to a vertebrate host where it can then be amplified and passed on to a person resulting in the zoonotic disease.Headache high fever and spotted rash are some effects of the disease with more severe cases resulting in organ damage and coma. Antibiotics such as doxycycline target the ribosome of R. rickettsii in order to inhibit protein synthesis of the bacteria providing a form of treatment for the disease."

It typically begins with a fever and headache which is followed a few days later with the development of a rash. The rash is generally made up of small spots of bleeding and starts on the wrists and ankles. Other symptoms may include muscle pains and vomiting. Long-term complications following recovery may include hearing loss or loss of part of an arm or leg.The disease is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii a type of bacterium that is primarily spread to humans by American dog ticks Rocky Mountain wood ticks and brown dog ticks. Rarely the disease is spread by blood transfusions. Diagnosis in the early stages is difficult. A number of laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis but treatment should be begun based on symptoms. It is within a group known as spotted fever rickettsiosis together with Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis Pacific Coast tick fever and rickettsialpox.Treatment of RMSF is with the antibiotic doxycycline. It works best when started early and is recommended in all age groups as well as during pregnancy. Antibiotics are not recommended for prevention. Approximately 0.5% of people who are infected die as a result. Before the discovery of tetracycline in the 1940s more than 10% of those with RMSF died.Fewer than 5000 cases are reported a year in the United States most often in June and July. It has been diagnosed throughout the contiguous United States Western Canada and parts of Central and South America. Rocky Mountain spotted fever was first identified in the 1800s in the Rocky Mountains."

        "article": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm swollen and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly the wrist and hands are involved with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body including skin eyes lungs heart nerves and blood. This may result in a low red blood cell count inflammation around the lungs and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia among others.The goals of treatment are to reduce pain decrease inflammation and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise the use of splints and braces or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications steroids and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when the disease does not respond to other treatments. However they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair replace or fuse joints may help in certain situations.RA affects about 24.5 million people as of 2015. This is 0.5\u20131% of adults in the developed world with between 5 and 50 per 100000 people newly developing the condition each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. It resulted in 38000 deaths in 2013 up from 28000 deaths in 1990. The first recognized description of RA was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landr\u00e9-Beauvais (1772\u20131840) of Paris. The term rheumatoid arthritis is based on the Greek for watery and inflamed joints."

Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur. Itching is more common in cases due to allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.The most common infectious causes in adults are viral whereas in children bacterial causes predominate. The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold. Both viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people. Allergies to pollen or animal hair are also a common cause. Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for culture.Prevention is partly by handwashing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. In the majority of viral cases there is no specific treatment. Most cases due to a bacterial infection also resolve without treatment; however antibiotics can shorten the illness. People who wear contact lenses and those whose infection is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia should be treated. Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamines or mast cell inhibitor drops.About 3 to 6 million people get acute conjunctivitis each year in the United States. Typically people get better in one or two weeks. If visual loss significant pain sensitivity to light or signs of herpes occur or if symptoms do not improve after a week further diagnosis and treatment may be required.

They are maladaptive biological and psychological responses to short- or long-term exposures to physical or emotional stressors.

However the World Health Organization's ICD-11 excludes OCD but categorizes PTSD Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) adjustment disorder as stress-related disorders.Stress is a conscious or unconscious psychological feeling or physical condition resulting from physical or mental 'positive or negative pressure' that overwhelms adaptive capacities. It is a psychological process initiated by events that threaten harm or challenge an organism or that exceed available coping resources and it is characterized by psychological responses that are directed towards adaptation. Stress is wear and tear on the body in response to stressful agents. Hans Selye called such agents: stressors which are physical physiological or sociocultural. Stress-related disorders differ from anxiety disorders and do not constitute a normative concept.A person typically is stressed when positive or negative (e.g. threatening) experiences temporarily strain or overwhelm adaptive capacities. Stress is highly individualized and depends on variables such as the novelty rate intensity duration or personal interpretation of the input and genetic or experiential factors. Both acute and chronic stress can intensify morbidity from anxiety disorders. One person's fun may be another person's stressor. For an example panic attacks are more frequent when the predisposed person is exposed to stressors."

Repetitive drug use often alters brain function in ways that perpetuate craving and weakens (but does not completely negate) self-control. This phenomenon \u2013 drugs reshaping brain function \u2013 has led to an understanding of addiction as a brain disorder with a complex variety of psychosocial as well as neurobiological (and thus involuntary) factors that are implicated in addiction's development. Classic signs of addiction include compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli preoccupation with substances or behavior and continued use despite negative consequences. Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward) coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).Examples of drug (or more generally substance) addictions include alcoholism cannabis addiction amphetamine addiction cocaine addiction nicotine addiction opioid addiction and eating or food addiction. Behavioral addictions may include gambling addiction shopping addiction stalking internet addiction social media addiction obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder video game addiction and sexual addiction. The DSM-5 and ICD-10 only recognize gambling addictions as behavioral addictions but the ICD-11 also recognizes gaming addictions."

        "article": "Alcohol sometimes referred to by the chemical name ethanol is a depressant drug found in fermented beverages such as beer wine and distilled spirit \u2014 in particular rectified spirit. Ethanol is colloquially referred to as \"alcohol\" because it is the most prevalent alcohol in alcoholic beverages but technically all alcoholic beverages contain several types of psychoactive alcoholsthat are categorized as primary secondary or tertiary; Primary and secondary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes and ketones respectively while tertiary alcohols are generally resistant to oxidation; Ethanol is a primary alcohol that has unpleasant actions in the body many of which are mediated by its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde. Less prevalent alcohols found in alcoholic beverages are secondary and tertiary alcohols. For example the tertiary alcohol 2M2B which is up to 50 times more potent than ethanol and found in trace quantities in alcoholic beverages has been synthesized and used as a designer drug. Alcoholic beverages are sometimes laced with toxic alcohols such as methanol (the simplest alcohol) and isopropyl alcohol. A mild brief exposure to isopropyl alcohol (which is only moderately more toxic than ethanol) is unlikely to cause any serious harm but many methanol poisoning incidents have occurred through history since methanol is lethal even in small quantities as little as 10\u201315 milliliters (2\u20133 teaspoons). Ethanol is used to treat methanol and ethylene glycol toxicity.A DrugScience 2010 study rated alcohol the most harmful drug overall and the only drug more harmful to others than to the users themselves. Ethanol is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen hepatotoxin neurotoxin ototoxin and birth defect agent and is considered to be an anaphrodisiac. The World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health in April 2023 that \"there is no safe amount that does not affect health\".Alcohol serves various purposes for example it is one of the oldest and most commonly consumed recreational drugs it is used for self-medication and it is frequently involved in alcohol-related crimes such as drunk driving public intoxication and underage drinking. Some esoteric religions and schools incorporate the use of alcohol for spiritual purposes. However alcohol has a variety of short-term and long-term adverse effects on health. Short-term effects from moderate consumption include happiness and euphoria decreased anxiety decreased social inhibition sedation impairment of cognitive memory motor and sensory function while binge drinking may result in generalized impairment of neurocognitive function dizziness analgesia ataxia general anaesthesia nausea vomiting hangover-like symptoms blackout and generalized depression of central nervous system (CNS) function. In high amounts alcohol may cause alcohol intoxication characterized by loss of consciousness or in severe cases death; in 2016 3.0 million deaths was responsible for excessive alcohol use worldwide. Long-term effects are considered to be a major global public health issue and includes alcoholism abuse withdrawal fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) liver disease hepatitis cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy polyneuropathy dementia hallucinosis brain damage and cancers such as breast cancer. Most health risks from alcohol stem from excessive or frequent use but some like cancer risk can occur even with light to moderate drinking.Alcohol works in the brain primarily by increasing the effects of \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; by facilitating GABA's actions alcohol suppresses the activity of the CNS. The substance also directly affects a number of other neurotransmitter systems including those of glutamate glycine acetylcholine and serotonin. The pleasurable effects of alcohol ingestion are the result of increased levels of dopamine and endogenous opioids in the reward pathways of the brain."

White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusions but they are part of the immune system and also fight infections. Plasma is the \"yellowish\" liquid part of blood which acts as a buffer and contains proteins and other important substances needed for the body's overall health. Platelets are involved in blood clotting preventing the body from bleeding. Before these components were known doctors believed that blood was homogeneous.

        "article": "Brain stimulation reward (BSR) is a pleasurable phenomenon elicited via direct stimulation of specific brain regions originally discovered by James Olds and Peter Milner.  BSR can serve as a robust operant reinforcer. Targeted stimulation activates the reward system circuitry and establishes response habits similar to those established by natural rewards such as food and sex. Experiments on BSR soon demonstrated that stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus along with other regions of the brain associated with natural reward was both rewarding as well as motivation-inducing. Electrical brain stimulation and intracranial drug injections produce robust reward sensation due to a relatively direct activation of the reward circuitry.  This activation is considered to be more direct than rewards produced by natural stimuli as those signals generally travel through the more indirect peripheral nerves. BSR has been found in all vertebrates tested including humans and it has provided a useful tool for understanding how natural rewards are processed by specific brain regions and circuits as well the neurotransmission associated with the reward system.Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) is the operant conditioning method used to produce BSR in an experimental setting.  ICSS typically involves subjects with permanent electrode implants in one of several regions of the brain known to produce BSR when stimulated.  Subjects are trained to continuously respond to electrical stimulation of that brain region.  ICSS studies have been particularly useful for examining the effects of various pharmacological manipulations on reward sensitivity.  ICSS has been utilized as a means to gauge addiction liability for drugs of many classes including those that act on monoaminergic opioid and cholinergic neurotransmission.  These data correlate well with findings from self-administration studies on the addictive properties of drugs."

Most people exposed to B. pseudomallei experience no symptoms; however those who do experience symptoms have signs and symptoms that range from mild such as fever and skin changes to severe with pneumonia abscesses and septic shock that could cause death. Approximately 10% of people with melioidosis develop symptoms that last longer than two months termed \"chronic melioidosis\".Humans are infected with B. pseudomallei by contact with contaminated soil or water. The bacteria enter the body through wounds inhalation or ingestion. Person-to-person or animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare. The infection is constantly present in Southeast Asia particularly in northeast Thailand and northern Australia. In temperate countries such as Europe and the United States melioidosis cases are usually imported from countries where melioidosis is endemic. The signs and symptoms of melioidosis resemble tuberculosis and misdiagnosis is common. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by the growth of B. pseudomallei from an infected person's blood or other bodily fluid such as pus sputum and urine. Those with melioidosis are treated first with an \"intensive phase\" course of intravenous antibiotics (most commonly ceftazidime) followed by a several-month treatment course of co-trimoxazole. In countries with the advanced healthcare system approximately 10% of people with melioidosis die from the disease. In less developed countries the death rate could reach 40%.Efforts to prevent melioidosis include: wearing protective gear while handling contaminated water or soil practising hand hygiene drinking boiled water and avoiding direct contact with soil water or heavy rain. There is little evidence in supporting the use of melioidosis prophylaxis in humans. The antibiotic co-trimoxazole is used as a preventative only for individuals at high risk for getting the disease after being exposed to the bacteria in laboratory settings. One study conducted in 2018 determined that the drug could be useful in preventing melioidosis in high-risk renal failure patients undergoing haemodialysis. There is no approved vaccine for melioidosis.Approximately 165000 people are infected by melioidosis per year resulting in about 89000 deaths based on a mathematical model published in 2016. Diabetes is a major risk factor for melioidosis; over half of melioidosis cases are in people with diabetes. Increased rainfall and severe weather events such as thunderstorms are associated with an increased number of melioidosis cases in endemic areas."

        "article": "Nicotine is a naturally produced alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants (most predominantly in tobacco and Duboisia hopwoodii) and is widely used recreationally as a stimulant and anxiolytic. As a pharmaceutical drug it is used for smoking cessation to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChR\u03b19 and nAChR\u03b110) where it acts as a receptor antagonist.Nicotine constitutes approximately 0.6\u20133.0% of the dry weight of tobacco. Nicotine is also present at ppb-concentrations in edible plants in the family Solanaceae including potatoes tomatoes and eggplants though sources disagree on whether this has any biological significance to human consumers. It functions as an antiherbivore toxin; consequently nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past and neonicotinoids (structurally similar to nicotine) such as imidacloprid are some of the most effective and widely used insecticides.Nicotine is highly addictive. Slow-release forms (gums and patches when used correctly) can be less addictive and help in quitting. Animal research suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors present in tobacco smoke may enhance nicotine's addictive properties. An average cigarette yields about 2\u00a0mg of absorbed nicotine.The estimated lower dose limit for fatal outcomes is 500\u20131000\u00a0mg of ingested nicotine for an adult (6.5\u201313\u00a0mg/kg). Nicotine addiction involves drug-reinforced behavior compulsive use and relapse following abstinence. Nicotine dependence involves tolerance sensitization physical dependence psychological dependence and can cause distress. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include depressed mood stress anxiety irritability difficulty concentrating and sleep disturbances. Mild nicotine withdrawal symptoms are measurable in unrestricted smokers who experience normal moods only as their blood nicotine levels peak with each cigarette. On quitting withdrawal symptoms worsen sharply then gradually improve to a normal state.Nicotine use as a tool for quitting smoking has a good safety history. Animal studies suggest that nicotine may adversely affect cognitive development in adolescence but the relevance of these findings to human brain development is disputed. At low amounts it has a mild analgesic effect. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer \"nicotine is not generally considered to be a carcinogen.\"The Surgeon General of the United States indicates that evidence is inadequate to infer the presence or absence of a causal relationship between exposure to nicotine and risk for cancer. Nicotine has been shown to produce birth defects in humans and is considered a teratogen. The median lethal dose of nicotine in humans is unknown. High doses are known to cause nicotine poisoning organ failure and death through paralysis of respiratory muscles though serious or fatal overdoses are rare."

Other major perforating diseases are elastosis perforans serpiginosa and reactive perforating collagenosis. Recently however there is a controversy on categorizing Kyrle disease with perforating dermatosis or a subtype of acquired perforating collagenosis.Kyrle disease was first described by Josef Kyrle in 1916 when a diabetic woman presented generalized hyperkeratotic nodules. The disease is distinguished by large papules with central keratin plug on the skin usually on the legs of the patient and is often in conjunction with liver kidney or diabetic disorders. It can affect both females and males with a 6:1 ratio. The papules usually show up on the patient with an average age of 30 years. Kyrle disease is a rare disease unless there is a high count of patients with chronic kidney failure. The disease seems to be more prevalent in African Americans which can be correlated to the high incidence of diabetes mellitus and kidney failure in the population."

The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.The human tongue is divided into two parts an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back. The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove the median sulcus on the tongue's surface.There are two groups of muscles of the tongue. The four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to bone. The four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone."

When the body is too hot the body shunts blood from the deep veins to the superficial veins to facilitate heat transfer to the body's surroundings.  Superficial veins are often visible underneath the skin.  Those below the level of the heart tend to bulge out which can be readily witnessed in the hand where the veins bulge significantly less after the arm has been raised above the head for a short time. Veins become more visually prominent when lifting heavy weight especially after a period of proper strength training.Physiologically the superficial veins are not as important as the deep veins (as they carry less blood) and are sometimes removed in a procedure called vein stripping which is used to treat varicose veins."

It is typically used together with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical removal of the testicles to treat metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To a lesser extent it is used at high doses for locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) as a monotherapy without castration. Bicalutamide was also previously used as monotherapy to treat localized prostate cancer (LPC) but authorization for this use was withdrawn following unfavorable trial findings. Besides prostate cancer bicalutamide is limitedly used in the treatment of excessive hair growth and scalp hair loss in women as a puberty blocker and component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender girls and women to treat gonadotropin-independent early puberty in boys and to prevent overly long-lasting erections in men. It is taken by mouth.Common side effects of bicalutamide in men include breast growth breast tenderness and hot flashes. Other side effects in men include feminization and sexual dysfunction. Some side effects like breast changes and feminization are minimal when combined with castration. While the medication appears to produce few side effects in women its use in women is not explicitly approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at this time. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. In men with early prostate cancer bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase the likelihood of death from causes other than prostate cancer. Bicalutamide produces abnormal liver changes necessitating discontinuation in around 1% of people. Rarely it has been associated with cases of serious liver damage serious lung toxicity and sensitivity to light. Although the risk of adverse liver changes is small monitoring of liver function is recommended during treatment.Bicalutamide is a member of the nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) group of medications. It works by selectively blocking the androgen receptor (AR) the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It does not lower androgen levels. The medication can have some estrogen-like effects in men when used as a monotherapy due to increased estradiol levels. Bicalutamide is well-absorbed and its absorption is not affected by food. The elimination half-life of the medication is around one week. It shows peripheral selectivity in animals but crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier and affects both the body and brain in humans.Bicalutamide was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bicalutamide is available as a generic medication. The drug is sold in more than 80\u00a0countries including most developed countries. It was at one time the most widely used antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer with millions of men with the disease having been prescribed it. Although bicalutamide is also used for other indications besides prostate cancer the vast majority of prescriptions appear to be for treatment of prostate cancer."

        "article": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are members of a therapeutic drug class which reduces pain decreases inflammation decreases fever and prevents blood clots. Side effects depend on the specific drug its dose and duration of use but largely include an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds heart attack and kidney disease.The term non-steroidal common from around 1960 distinguishes these drugs from corticosteroids another class of anti-inflammatory drugs which during the 1950s had acquired a bad reputation due to overuse and side-effect problems after their initial introduction in 1948.NSAIDs work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (the COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes). In cells these enzymes are involved in the synthesis of key biological mediators namely prostaglandins which are involved in inflammation and thromboxanes which are involved in blood clotting.There are two general types of NSAIDs available: non-selective and COX-2 selective. Most NSAIDs are non-selective and inhibit the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. These NSAIDs while reducing inflammation also inhibit platelet aggregation and increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds. COX-2 selective inhibitors have fewer gastrointestinal side effects but promote thrombosis and some of these agents substantially increase the risk of heart attack. As a result certain COX-2 selective inhibitors\u2014such as rofecoxib\u2014are no longer used due to the high risk of undiagnosed vascular disease. These differential effects are due to the different roles and tissue localisations of each COX isoenzyme. By inhibiting physiological COX activity NSAIDs may cause deleterious effects on kidney function and perhaps as a result of water and sodium retention and decreases in renal blood flow may lead to heart problems. In addition NSAIDs can blunt the production of erythropoietin resulting in anaemia since haemoglobin needs this hormone to be produced.The most prominent NSAIDs are aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen; all available over the counter (OTC) in most countries. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only minor anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 and inhibiting endocannabinoid reuptake almost exclusively within the brain and only minimally in the rest of the body."

        "article": "Lyme disease also known as Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease caused by species of Borrelia bacteria transmitted by blood-feeding ticks in the genus Ixodes. The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash known as erythema migrans (EM) which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70\u201380% of infected people develop a rash. Early diagnosis can be difficult. Other early symptoms may include fever headaches and tiredness. If untreated symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face joint pains severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. Despite appropriate treatment about 10 to 20% of those affected develop joint pains memory problems and tiredness for at least six months.Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes. In the United States ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \"In most cases a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours) you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\" In Europe Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. In North America the bacterial species  Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. In Europe and Asia Borrelia afzelii Borrelia garinii B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people by other animals nor through food. Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful.Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin-based insect repellents. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. If an infection develops a number of antibiotics are effective including doxycycline amoxicillin and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful.Lyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Chronic symptoms following treatment are known as \"post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome\" (PTLDS). PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. Some healthcare providers claim that PTLDS is caused by persistent infection but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment.As of 2023 clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out but no vaccine was available. A vaccine LYMERix was produced but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs."

Pakistan falls into the \"very bad\" category when evaluating the right to reproductive health because the nation is fulfilling only 34.4% of what the nation is expected to achieve based on the resources (income) it has available."

        "article": "The cultivation of cannabis in Italy has a long history dating back to Roman times when it was primarily used to produce hemp ropes although pollen records from core samples show that Cannabaceae plants were present in the Italian peninsula since at least the Late Pleistocene while the earliest evidence of their use dates back to the Bronze Age. For a long time after the fall of Rome in the 5th century A.D. the cultivation of hemp although present in several Italian regions mostly consisted in small-scale productions aimed at satisfying the local needs for fabrics and ropes. Known as canapa in Italian the historical ubiquity of hemp is reflected in the different variations of the name given to the plant in the various regions including canape c\u00e0neva canava and canva (or canav\u00f2n for female plants) in northern Italy; canapuccia and canapone in the Po Valley; c\u00e0nnavo in Naples; c\u00e0nnavu in Calabria; cannavusa and c\u00e0nnavu in Sicily; c\u00e0nnau and cagnu in Sardinia.The mass cultivation of industrial cannabis for the production of hemp fiber in Italy really took off during the period of the Maritime Republics and the Age of Sail due to its strategic importance for the naval industry. In particular two main economic models were implemented between the 15th and 19th centuries for the cultivation of hemp and their primary differences essentially derived from the diverse relationships between landowners and hemp producers. The Venetian model was based on a state monopoly system by which the farmers had to sell the harvested hemp to the Arsenal at an imposed price in order to ensure preferential regular and advantageous supplies of the raw material for the navy as a matter of national security. Such system was particularly developed in the southern part of the province of Padua which was under the direct control of the administrators of the Arsenal. Conversely the Emilian model which was typical of the provinces of Bologna and Ferrara was strongly export-oriented and it was based on the mezzadria farming system by which for instance Bolognese landowners could relegate most of the production costs and risks to the farmers while also keeping for themselves the largest share of the profits.From the 18th century onwards hemp production in Italy established itself as one of the most important industries at an international level with the most productive areas being located in Emilia-Romagna Campania and Piedmont. The well renowned and flourishing Italian hemp sector continued well after the unification of the country in 1861 only to experience a sudden decline during the second half of the 20th century with the introduction of synthetic fibers and the start of the war on drugs and only recently it is slowly experiencing a resurgence."

Oral cavity and gastrointestinal involvement may also be seen.LCH and all its subtypes are characterized by monoclonal migration and proliferation of specific dendritic cells. The subcategorization of Letterer-Siwe disease is a historical eponym.  Designating the four subtypes of LCH as separate entities are mostly of historical significance because they are varied manifestations of the same underlying disease process and patients also often exhibit symptoms from more than one of the four syndromes.  Letterer-Siwe causes approximately 10% of LCH disease.Prevalence is estimated at 1:500000 and the disease almost exclusively occurs in children less than three years old. It is more common among Caucasian patients than in African American patients.Children with LCH with single organ involvement tend to have a better prognosis than patients with the multi-system involvement seen in Letter-Siwe disease.The name is derived from the names of Erich Letterer and Sture Siwe."

The critical chemical structural difference between tocotrienols and tocopherols is that tocotrienols have unsaturated isoprenoid side chains with three carbon-carbon double bonds versus saturated side chains for tocopherols (see Figure).Tocotrienols are compounds naturally occurring at higher levels in some vegetable oils including palm oil rice bran oil wheat germ barley saw palmetto annatto and certain other types of seeds nuts and grains and the oils derived from them.Chemically different analogues of vitamin E all show some activity as a chemical antioxidant but do not all have the same vitamin E equivalence. Tocotrienols demonstrate activity depending on the type of antioxidant performance being measured.  All tocotrienols have some physical antioxidant activity due to an ability to donate a hydrogen atom (a proton plus electron) from the hydroxyl group on the chromanol ring to free radical and reactive oxygen species. Historically studies of tocotrienols account for less than 1% of all research into vitamin E."

The purpose of the UV index is to help people effectively protect themselves from UV radiation which has health benefits in moderation but in excess causes sunburn skin aging DNA damage skin cancer immunosuppression and eye damage such as cataracts.The scale was developed by Canadian scientists in 1992 and then adopted and standardized by the UN's World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization in 1994. Public health organizations recommend that people protect themselves (for example by applying sunscreen to the skin and wearing a hat and sunglasses) if they spend substantial time outdoors when the UV index is 3 or higher; see the table below for more detailed recommendations."

They were first discovered in 1958 by Gardos who saw that calcium levels inside of a cell could affect the permeability of potassium through that cell membrane. Then in 1970 Meech was the first to observe that intracellular calcium could trigger potassium currents. In humans they are divided into three subtypes: large conductance or BK channels which have very high conductance which range from 100 to 300 pS intermediate conductance or IK channels with intermediate conductance ranging from 25 to 100 pS and small conductance or SK channels with small conductances from 2-25 pS.This family of ion channels is for the most part activated by intracellular Ca2+ and contains 8 members in the human genome. However some of these channels (the KCa4 and KCa5 channels) are responsive instead to other intracellular ligands such as Na+ Cl\u2212 and pH. Furthermore multiple members of family are both ligand and voltage activated further complicating the description of this family.  The KCa channel \u03b1 subunits have six or seven transmembrane segments similar to the KV channels but occasionally with an additional N-terminal transmembrane helix.  The \u03b1 subunits make homo- and hetero-tetrameric complexes. The calcium binding domain may be contained in the \u03b1 subunit sequence as in KCa1 or may be through an additional calcium binding protein such as calmodulin."

They are so called because of their small single channel conductance in the order of 10 pS. SK channels are a type of ion channel allowing potassium cations to cross the cell membrane and are activated (opened) by an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium through N-type calcium channels.  Their activation limits the firing frequency of action potentials and is important for regulating afterhyperpolarization in the neurons of the central nervous system as well as many other types of electrically excitable cells. This is accomplished through the hyperpolarizing leak of positively charged potassium ions along their concentration gradient into the extracellular space.  This hyperpolarization causes the membrane potential to become more negative. SK channels are thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity and therefore play important roles in learning and memory."

The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and largely continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. The band's style had evolved by their third album and first major label release City of Evil into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their founding drummer Jimmy \"The Rev\" Sullivan died in 2009. Despite his death Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of Dream Theater member Mike Portnoy and released and toured in support of their fifth album Nightmare in 2010 which debuted atop the Billboard 200 their first number one debut.In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King which was released in 2013 marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. It would feature a heavy metal and hard rock style with it being written as a tribute to their influences. Hail to the King charted as number 1 on the Billboard 200 the UK Albums chart as well as the Finnish Brazilian Canadian and Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late 2014 and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album The Stage in October 2016 which debuted as number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US. The Stage is their first conceptual album and marked another stylistic change for the band moving towards a progressive metal sound. The band released their eighth studio album Life Is But a Dream... a highly experimental record in June 2023.To date Avenged Sevenfold have released eight studio albums one live album/DVD two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide and their records have received numerous certification awards including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution (RIAA). They have also created four original songs for the Call of Duty: Black Ops series all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP Black Reign. The band were ranked No. 47 on Loudwire's list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time."

It is a type of erythema (redness of the skin or mucous membranes) characterised by bright pink or red circular lesions which have sharply-defined borders and faint central clearing. The lesions typically range from 3 to 10 cm in size and are distributed symmetrically over the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs and extensor surfaces. The lesions last between one and four weeks but have been known to be present on patients for as long as several months. The condition was first reported in 1816 by Jean Cruveilhier and is thought to be linked to other skin conditions such as urticaria and systemic lupus erythematosus.An association with bradykinin has been proposed in the case of hereditary angioedema."

        "article": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a disorder that results in recurrent attacks of severe swelling. The swelling most commonly affects the arms legs face intestinal tract and airway. If the intestinal tract is affected abdominal pain and vomiting may occur. Swelling of the airway can result in its obstruction and trouble breathing. Without preventive treatment attacks typically occur every two weeks and last for a few days.There are three main types of HAE. Types I and II are caused by a mutation in the SERPING1 gene which encodes the C1 inhibitor protein while type III is often due to a mutation in the F12 (factor XII) gene. The result is increased levels of bradykinin which promotes swelling. The condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or occur as a new mutation. Triggers for an attack may include minor trauma or stress but attacks often occur without any obvious preceding event. Diagnosis of types I and II is based on measurement of C4 and C1-inhibitor levels.Management of HAE involves efforts to prevent attacks and the treatment of attacks if they occur. During an attack supportive care such as intravenous fluids and airway support may be required. C1 inhibitor medications can be used for both prevention and treatment while ecallantide and icatibant can be used to treat acute attacks.HAE affects approximately 1 in 50000 people. The condition is typically first noticed in childhood. Type I and II affected females and males equally while type III affects females more often than males. When the airway is involved without treatment the risk of death is about 25%. With treatment outcomes are generally good. The condition was first described in 1888 by Canadian physician William Osler."

The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a streptococcal throat infection. Signs and symptoms include fever multiple painful joints involuntary muscle movements and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of the cases. Damage to the heart valves known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD) usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one. The damaged valves may result in heart failure atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.Rheumatic fever may occur following an infection of the throat by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. If the infection is left untreated rheumatic fever occurs in up to three percent of people. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the production of antibodies against a person's own tissues. Due to their genetics some people are more likely to get the disease when exposed to the bacteria than others. Other risk factors include malnutrition and poverty. Diagnosis of RF is often based on the presence of signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection.Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics such as penicillin decreases the risk of developing rheumatic fever. In order to avoid antibiotic misuse this often involves testing people with sore throats for the infection; however testing might not be available in the developing world. Other preventive measures include improved sanitation. In those with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease prolonged periods of antibiotics are sometimes recommended. Gradual return to normal activities may occur following an attack. Once RHD develops treatment is more difficult. Occasionally valve replacement surgery or valve repair is required. Otherwise complications are treated as usual.Rheumatic fever occurs in about 325000 children each year and about 33.4\u00a0million people currently have rheumatic heart disease. Those who develop RF are most often between the ages of 5 and 14 with 20% of first-time attacks occurring in adults. The disease is most common in the developing world and among indigenous peoples in the developed world. In 2015 it resulted in 319400 deaths down from 374000 deaths in 1990. Most deaths occur in the developing world where as many as 12.5% of people affected may die each year. Descriptions of the condition are believed to date back to at least the 5th century BCE in the writings of Hippocrates. The disease is so named because its symptoms are similar to those of some rheumatic disorders."

Additionally the law requires registered gas fitters to report poor and dangerous gas installations (reg.6).Responsible persons are generally employers but also include various managers and occupiers of premises (reg.2). Though the regulations do not impose a specific obligation on employees they have a general obligation under section 7 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to take care of safety. The Health and Safety Executive recommends that they report incidents to their employer and encourages voluntary notification to the relevant regulating authority.There are specific regulations as to mines and quarries (reg.8/ Sch.5) and offshore installations (reg.9/ Sch.6).Medical treatments are exempt as are injuries arising from road traffic accidents and to members of the armed forces (reg.10).Breach of the regulations is a crime punishable on summary conviction with a fine of up to \u00a3400. If convicted on indictment in the Crown Court an offender can be sentenced to an unlimited fine. Either an individual or a corporation can be punished and sentencing practice is published by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. For example in 2000 Salford City Council were fined \u00a3115000 for a breach of the regulations.It is a defence that the responsible person was not aware of the event requiring reporting or notification and that he had taken all reasonable steps to have such events brought to his notice (reg.11). The burden of proof of such a defence is on the defendant on the balance of probabilities."

        "article": "A periorbital hematoma commonly called a black eye or a shiner (associated with boxing or stick sports such as hockey) is bruising around the eye commonly due to an injury to the face rather than to the eye. The name refers to the dark-colored bruising which is the result of accumulated blood and fluid in the loose areolar tissue following a blow to the head. This blood tracks freely under the scalp producing a generalised swelling over the dome of the skull but cannot pass into either occipital or the temple regions because of the bony attachments of the occipitofrontalis muscle. But this fluid can however track forward into the eyelid because the occipitofrontalis muscle has no bony attachment anteriorly. This leads to formation of hematoma a few hours after the head injury or cranial operation. If injury is more extensive potentially even a skull fracture an apparent black eye can sometimes worsen and may require professional medical treatment before it will resolve.  This is more likely if the area around both eyes has been injured (raccoon eyes) or if there is a history of prior head injury or fracture around the eye.  Though disfiguring the vast majority of black eyes are not serious require little or no treatment and will resolve spontaneously within a week or two.Bleeding within the eye a condition called a hyphema is more serious: it can permanently reduce vision and can damage the cornea. In some cases abnormally high pressure inside the eyeball (ocular hypertension) can also result."

The organisms are ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water.They group with the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria.Two major diseases associated with Aeromonas are gastroenteritis and wound infections with or without bacteremia. Gastroenteritis typically occurs after the ingestion of contaminated water or food whereas wound infections result from exposure to contaminated water. In its most severe form Aeromonas spp. can cause necrotizing fasciitis which is life-threatening usually requiring treatment with antibiotics and even amputation.Although some potential virulence factors (e.g. endotoxins hemolysins enterotoxins adherence factors) have been identified their precise roles are unknown."

        "article": "Anaerobic infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria. Obligately anaerobic bacteria do not grow on solid media in room air (0.04% carbon dioxide and 21% oxygen); facultatively anaerobic bacteria can grow in the presence or absence of air. Microaerophilic bacteria do not grow at all aerobically or grow poorly but grow better under 10% carbon dioxide or anaerobically. Anaerobic bacteria can be divided into strict anaerobes that can not grow in the presence of more than 0.5% oxygen and moderate anaerobic bacteria that are able of growing between 2 and 8% oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria usually do not possess catalase but some can generate superoxide dismutase which protects them from oxygen.The clinically important anaerobes in decreasing frequency are:1. Six genera of Gram-negative rods (Bacteroides Prevotella Porphyromonas Fusobacterium Bilophila and Sutterella spp.);2. Gram-positive cocci (primarily Peptostreptococcus spp.);3. Gram-positive spore-forming (Clostridium spp.) and non-spore-forming bacilli (Actinomyces Propionibacterium Eubacterium Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp.); and4. Gram-negative cocci (mainly Veillonella spp.) .The frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacterial strains varies in different infectious sites. Mixed infections caused by numerous aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are often observed in clinical situations.Anaerobic bacteria are a common cause of infections some of which can be serious and life-threatening. Because anaerobes are the predominant components of the normal flora of the skin and mucous membranes they are a common cause of infections of endogenous origin. Because of their fastidious nature anaerobes are hard to culture and isolate and are often not recovered from infected sites. The administration of delayed or inappropriate therapy against these organisms may lead to failures in eradication of these infections. The isolation of anaerobic bacteria requires adequate methods for collection transportation and cultivation of clinical specimens. The management of anaerobic infection is often difficult because of the slow growth of anaerobic organisms which can delay their identification by the frequent polymicrobial nature of these infections and by the increasing resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobials."

Alternately the swelling could contain a hard lump when these materials harden or if the abscess becomes impacted with substrate (e.g. soil straw etc.) Bumblefoot may also present as redness swelling small red sores and depending upon severity and length of time with the condition  lesions cracks or discoloration.Lameness puts more weight-bearing duty on an animal's strong leg(s); this leads to excessive pressure being placed on the good foot (or feet) which increases the chance of an abrasion occurring that could develop a bumblefoot infection. Consequently in cases of lameness the good leg(s) should be examined for potential cuts and infections. Overweight animals are more at risk of developing bumblefoot for the same reason; their extra weight causes excessive pressure on their feet. However the infection can usually be attributed to poor husbandry practices so is much more likely to occur in captive animals than in those in the wild. Ulcerative pododermatitis is referred to as \"sore hocks\" when it affects a rabbit and \"bumblefoot\" when it affects a bird. The terms \"sore hocks\" and \"bumblefoot\" are used interchangeably when describing ulcerative pododermatitis in rodents."

        "article": "Diabetic foot infection is any infection of the foot in a diabetic person. The most frequent cause of hospitalization for diabetic patients is due to foot infections. Symptoms may include pus from a wound redness swelling pain warmth tachycardia or tachypnea. Complications can include infection of the bone tissue death amputation or sepsis. They are common and occur equally frequently in males and females. Older people are more commonly affected.They most often form following a diabetic foot ulcer though not all foot ulcers become infected. Diabetic foot ulcers can be caused by vascular disease or neuropathy and its prevalence occurs in approximately 25% of diabetics throughout their lifetime. Some risk factors for developing diabetic foot infections include history of repeated foot ulcers foot ulcers lasting for longer than 30 days poor control over blood glucose levels peripheral neuropathy renal impairment peripheral artery disease injury or trauma to foot walking barefoot frequently and history of amputation in lower limbs. Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial (contain multiple infective organisms) and bacteria that are commonly involved include staphylococcus including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) streptococci pseudomonas and gram-negative bacteria. Previously MRSA infections were usually acquired from hospital settings however recently MRSA infections acquired from the community are becoming more prevalent and are linked to poor treatment outcomes for diabetic patients. Some risk factors for developing MRSA infections include use of antibiotics that cover a broad spectrum of pathogens for a long duration of time prolonged hospital stay or certain surgical procedures. The underlying mechanism of diabetic foot infections often involves poor blood flow and peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and may be supported by deep tissue culture.Treatment involves proper wound care and antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa empiric therapy is not warranted unless the patient had a previous infection with a culture identifying the organism or if the patient has risk factors for it such as frequent use of wet dressings or living in hot climates. MRSA empiric therapy is also not warranted unless the patient has a critical infection such as sepsis  if the rate of MRSA infections are particularly high in a local area or if the patient had a previous MRSA infection. The duration of antibiotics depends on the severity of infection ranging anywhere from 1\u201312 weeks. Treatment of mild-moderate infections should last 1\u20132 weeks and typically requires oral antibiotics that cover staphylococci and streptococci. Severe infections typically require IV antibiotics that cover more pathogens such as gram positive organisms gram negative organisms and obligate anaerobes to allow for better treatment outcomes. Total antibiotic treatment of severe infections should be approximately 2\u20133 weeks or more depending on how extensive the infection is. Prevention includes wearing appropriate shoes regular foot examinations and control of risk factors."

Damages may include bleeding bone fractures organ damage wound infection loss of the ability to move part of the body and in severe cases death. Damage depends on the part of the body hit the path the bullet follows through the body and the type and speed of the bullet. Long-term complications can include bowel obstruction failure to thrive neurogenic bladder and paralysis recurrent cardiorespiratory distress and pneumothorax hypoxic brain injury leading to early dementia amputations chronic pain and pain with light touch (hyperalgesia) deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolus limb swelling and debility and lead poisoning.Factors that determine rates of gun violence vary by country. These factors may include the illegal drug trade easy access to firearms substance misuse including alcohol mental health problems firearm laws social attitudes economic differences and occupations such as being a police officer. Where guns are more common altercations more often end in death.Before management begins the area must be verified as safe. This is followed by stopping major bleeding then assessing and supporting the airway breathing and circulation. Firearm laws particularly background checks and permit to purchase decrease the risk of death from firearms. Safer firearm storage may decrease the risk of firearm-related deaths in children.In 2015 about a million gunshot wounds occurred from interpersonal violence. In 2016 firearms resulted in 251000 deaths globally up from 209000 in 1990. Of these deaths 161000 (64%) were the result of assault 67500 (27%) were the result of suicide and 23000 (9%) were accidents. In the United States guns resulted in about 40000 deaths in 2017. Firearm-related deaths are most common in males between the ages of 20 and 24 years. Economic costs due to gunshot wounds have been estimated at $140 billion a year in the United States."

        "article": "An open fracture also called a compound fracture is a type of bone fracture (broken bone) that has an open wound in the skin near the fractured bone. The skin wound is usually caused by the bone breaking through the surface of the skin. An open fracture can be life threatening or limb-threatening (person may be at risk of losing a limb) due to the risk of a deep infection and/or bleeding. Open fractures are often caused by high energy trauma such as road traffic accidents and are associated with a high degree of damage to the bone and nearby soft tissue. Other potential complications include nerve damage or impaired bone healing including malunion or nonunion. The severity of open fractures can vary. For diagnosing and classifying open fractures Gustilo-Anderson open fracture classification is the most commonly used method. This classification system can also be used to guide treatment and to predict clinical outcomes. Advanced trauma life support is the first line of action in dealing with open fractures and to rule out other life-threatening condition in cases of trauma. The person is also administered antibiotics for at least 24 hours to reduce the risk of an infection. Cephalosporins sometimes with aminoglycosides are generally the first line of antibiotics and are used usually for at least three days. Therapeutic irrigation wound debridement early wound closure and bone fixation core principles in management of open fractures. All these actions aimed to reduce the risk of infections and promote bone healing. The bone that is most commonly injured is the tibia and working-age young men are the group of people who are at highest risk of an open fracture. Older people with osteoporosis and soft-tissue problems are also at risk."

        "article": "Wound healing refers to a living organism's replacement of destroyed or damaged tissue by newly produced tissue.In undamaged skin the epidermis (surface epithelial layer) and dermis (deeper connective layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage. This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (hemostasis) inflammation tissue growth (cell proliferation) and tissue remodeling (maturation and cell differentiation). Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage. The wound-healing process is not only complex but fragile and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing chronic wounds. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes venous or arterial disease infection and metabolic deficiencies of old age.Wound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient's needs it can range from the simplest first aid to entire nursing specialties such as wound ostomy and continence nursing and burn center care."

        "article": "A fungus (pl.: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as one of the traditional eukaryotic kingdoms along with Animalia Plantae and either Protista or Protozoa and Chromista.A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants bacteria and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Fungi like animals are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means of mobility except for spores (a few of which are flagellated) which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes) that share a common ancestor (i.e. they form a monophyletic group) an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek \u03bc\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 mykes mushroom). In the past mycology was regarded as a branch of botany although it is now known that fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.Abundant worldwide most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants animals or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products such as wine beer and soy sauce. Since the 1940s fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics and more recently various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins such as alkaloids and polyketides that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g. rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of taxa with varied ecologies life cycle strategies and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However little is known of the true biodiversity of the fungus kingdom which has been estimated at 2.2\u00a0million to 3.8\u00a0million species. Of these only about 148000 have been described with over 8000 species known to be detrimental to plants and at least 300 that can be pathogenic to humans. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus Christiaan Hendrik Persoon and Elias Magnus Fries fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g. characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics have opened the way for DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published in the first decade of the 21st century have helped reshape the classification within the fungi kingdom which is divided into one subkingdom seven phyla and ten subphyla."

It is curable only when diagnosed early. Symptoms depend on where in the body the infection occurs. It most commonly infects the nose sinuses eyes and brain resulting in a runny nose one-sided facial swelling and pain headache fever blurred vision bulging or displacement of the eye (proptosis) and tissue death. Other forms of disease may infect the lungs stomach and intestines and skin. The fatality rate is about 54%.It is spread by spores of molds of the order Mucorales most often through inhalation contaminated food or contamination of open wounds. These fungi are common in soils decomposing organic matter (such as rotting fruit and vegetables) and animal manure but usually do not affect people. It is not transmitted between people. Risk factors include diabetes with persistently high blood sugar levels or diabetic ketoacidosis low white blood cells cancer organ transplant iron overload kidney problems long-term steroids or use of immunosuppressants and to a lesser extent in HIV/AIDS.Diagnosis is by biopsy and culture with medical imaging to help determine the extent of disease. It may appear similar to aspergillosis. Treatment is generally with amphotericin B and surgical debridement. Preventive measures include wearing a face mask in dusty areas avoiding contact with water-damaged buildings and protecting the skin from exposure to soil such as when gardening or certain outdoor work. It tends to progress rapidly and is fatal in about half of sinus cases and almost all cases of the widespread type.Mucormycosis is usually rare  but is now ~80 times more common in India. People of any age may be affected including premature infants.  The first known case of mucormycosis was possibly the one described by Friedrich K\u00fcchenmeister in 1855. The disease has been reported in natural disasters; 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2011 Joplin tornado. During the COVID-19 pandemic an association between mucormycosis and COVID-19 has been reported. This association is thought to relate to reduced immune function during the course of the illness and may also be related to glucocorticoid therapy for COVID-19. A rise in cases was particularly noted in India."

O. unilateralis infects ants of the tribe Camponotini with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their mandibles to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf where the host remains after its eventual death. The process leading up to mortality takes 4\u201310 days and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting bodies grow from the ant's head rupturing to release the fungus's spores. O. unilateralis is in turn also susceptible to fungal infection itself an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.Ophiocordyceps unilateralis and related species are known to engage in an active secondary metabolism for among other reasons the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism an interest in the species has been taken by natural products chemists with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the polyketide family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory anti-infective and anticancer agents."

The long bones of the arms and legs are most commonly involved in children e.g. the femur and humerus while the feet spine and hips are most commonly involved in adults.The cause is usually a bacterial infection but rarely can be a fungal infection. It may occur by spread from the blood or from surrounding tissue. Risks for developing osteomyelitis include diabetes intravenous drug use prior removal of the spleen and trauma to the area. Diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and basic laboratory tests as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). This is because plain radiographs are unremarkable in the first few days following acute infection. Diagnosis is further confirmed by blood tests medical imaging or bone biopsy.Treatment of bacterial osteomyelitis often involves both antimicrobials and surgery. In people with poor blood flow amputation may be required. Treatment of the relatively rare fungal osteomyelitis as mycetoma infection entails the use of antifungal medications. In contrast to bacterial osteomyelitis amputation or large bony resections is more common in neglected fungal osteomyelitis (mycetoma) where infections of the foot account for the majority of cases. Treatment outcomes of bacterial osteomyelitis are generally good when the condition has only been present a short time. About 2.4 per 100000 people are affected each year. The young and old are more commonly affected. Males are more commonly affected than females. The condition was described at least as early as the 300s BC by Hippocrates. Prior to the availability of antibiotics the risk of death was significant."

Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body quick reflexes sharp teeth and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing purring trilling hissing growling and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide contributing to the extinction of bird mammal and reptile species.As of 2017 the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States with 95.6\u00a0million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9\u00a0million pet cats as of 2020.

The name refers to the dewclaw's alleged tendency to brush dew away from grass. On dogs and cats the dewclaws are on the inside of the front legs similarly to a human's thumb which shares evolutionary homology.  Although many animals have dewclaws other similar species do not such as horses giraffes and the African wild dog."

The collars are named from the ruffs worn in the Elizabethan era.The device is generally attached to the pet's usual collar with strings or tabs passed through holes punched in the sides of the plastic. The neck of the collar should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well others will not eat or drink with the collar in place and the collar is temporarily removed for meals.While purpose-made collars can be purchased from veterinarians or pet stores they can also be made from plastic and cardboard or by using plastic flowerpots wastebaskets buckets or lampshades.

        "article": "Reactive arthritis also known as Reiter's syndrome is a form of inflammatory arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body (cross-reactivity). Coming into contact with bacteria and developing an infection can trigger the disease. By the time the patient presents with symptoms often the \"trigger\" infection has been cured or is in remission in chronic cases thus making determination of the initial cause difficult.The arthritis often is coupled with other characteristic symptoms; this has been called Reiter's syndrome Reiter's disease or Reiter's arthritis.  The term \"reactive arthritis\" is increasingly used as a substitute for this designation because of Hans Reiter's war crimes with the Nazi Party.The manifestations of reactive arthritis include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory arthritis of large joints inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis and urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Arthritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive arthritis. Patients can also present with mucocutaneous lesions as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate balanitis and keratoderma blennorrhagicum. Enthesitis can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain. Not all affected persons have all the manifestations.The clinical pattern of reactive arthritis commonly consists of an inflammation of fewer than five joints which often includes the knee or sacroiliac joint. The arthritis may be \"additive\" (more joints become inflamed in addition to the primarily affected one) or \"migratory\" (new joints become inflamed after the initially inflamed site has already improved).Reactive arthritis is an RF-seronegative HLA-B27-linked arthritis often precipitated by genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with Salmonella Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (with Chlamydia trachomatis); however it also can happen after group A streptococcal infections.It most commonly strikes individuals aged 20\u201340 years of age is more common in men than in women and more common in white than in black people. This is owing to the high frequency of the HLA-B27 gene in the white population. It can occur in epidemic form. Patients with HIV have an increased risk of developing reactive arthritis as well.Numerous cases during World Wars I and II focused attention on the triad of arthritis urethritis and conjunctivitis (often with additional mucocutaneous lesions) which at that time was also referred to as Fiessenger\u2013Leroy\u2013Reiter syndrome."

        "article": "Drug injection is a method of introducing a drug into the bloodstream via a hollow hypodermic needle which is pierced through the skin into the body (usually intravenously but also at an intramuscular or subcutaneous location). Intravenous therapy a form of drug injection is universally practiced in modernized medical care. As of 2004 there were 13.2 million people worldwide who self-administered injection drugs outside of medical supervision of which 22% are from developed countries.A wide variety of drugs are injected often opioids: these may include legally prescribed medicines and medication such as morphine as well as stronger compounds often favored in recreational drug use which are often illegal. Although there are various methods of taking drugs injection is favoured by some people as the full effects of the drug are experienced very quickly typically in five to ten seconds. It also bypasses first-pass metabolism in the liver resulting in higher bioavailability and efficiency for many drugs (such as morphine or diacetylmorphine/heroin; roughly two-thirds of which is destroyed in the liver when consumed orally) than oral ingestion would. The effect is that the person gets a stronger (yet shorter-acting) effect from the same amount of the drug. Drug injection is therefore often related to substance dependence.In recreational-use drug culture preparation may include mixing the powdered drug with water to create an aqueous solution and then the solution is injected. This act is often colloquially referred to as \"slamming\" \"shooting\u00a0up\" \"smashing\" \"banging\" \"pinning\" or \"jacking-up\" often depending on the specific drug subculture in which the term is used (e.g. heroin cocaine or methamphetamine)."

        "article": "An eating disorder is a mental disorder defined by abnormal eating behaviors that adversely affect a person's physical or mental health. Types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder where the patient eats a large amount in a short period of time; anorexia nervosa where the person has an intense fear of gaining weight and restricts food or overexercises to manage this fear; bulimia nervosa where individuals eat a large quantity (binging) then try to rid themselves of the food (purging); pica where the patient eats non-food items; rumination syndrome where the patient regurgitates undigested or minimally digested food; avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) where people have a reduced or selective food intake due to some psychological reasons; and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders. Anxiety disorders depression and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders. These disorders do not include obesity. People often experience comorbidity between an eating disorder and OCD. It is estimated 20\u201360% of patients with an ED have a history of OCD.The causes of eating disorders are not clear although both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role. Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute to some eating disorders. Individuals who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders. Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities.Treatment can be effective for many eating disorders. Treatment varies by disorder and may involve counseling dietary advice reducing excessive exercise and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food. Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms. Hospitalization may be needed in more serious cases. About 70% of people with anorexia and 50% of people with bulimia recover within five years. Only 10% of people with eating disorders receive treatment and of those approximately 80% do not receive the proper care. Many are sent home weeks earlier than the recommended stay and are not provided with the necessary treatment. Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20% to 60%. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death. When people experience comorbidity with an eating disorder and OCD certain aspects of treatment can be negatively impacted. OCD can make it harder to recover from obsession over weight and shape body dissatisfaction and body checking. This is in part because ED cognitions serve a similar purpose to OCD obsessions and compulsions (e.g. safety behaviors as temporary relief from anxiety). Research shows OCD does not have an impact on the BMI of patients during treatment.Estimates of the prevalence of eating disorders vary widely reflecting differences in gender age and culture as well as methods used for diagnosis and measurement.In the developed world anorexia affects about 0.4% and bulimia affects about 1.3% of young women in a given year. Binge eating disorder affects about 1.6% of women and 0.8% of men in a given year. According to one analysis the percent of women who will have anorexia at some point in their lives may be up to 4% or up to 2% for bulimia and binge eating disorders. Rates of eating disorders appear to be lower in less developed countries. Anorexia and bulimia occur nearly ten times more often in females than males. The typical onset of eating disorders is in late childhood to early adulthood. Rates of other eating disorders are not clear."

        "article": "An injection (often and usually referred to as a \"shot\" in US English a \"jab\" in UK English or a \"jag\" in Scottish English and Scots) is the act of administering a liquid especially a drug into a person's body using a needle (usually a hypodermic needle) and a syringe. An injection is considered a form of parenteral drug administration; it does not involve absorption in the digestive tract. This allows the medication to be absorbed more rapidly and avoid the first pass effect. There are many types of injection which are generally named after the body tissue the injection is administered into. This includes common injections such as subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous injections as well as less common injections such as intraperitoneal intraosseous intracardiac intraarticular and intracavernous injections.Injections are among the most common health care procedures with at least 16 billion administered in developing and transitional countries each year. Of these 95% are used in curative care or as treatment for a condition 3% are to provide immunizations/vaccinations and the rest are used for other purposes including blood transfusions. The term injection is sometimes used synonymously with inoculation but injection does not only refer to the act of inoculation. Injections generally administer a medication as a bolus (or one-time) dose but can also be used for continuous drug administration. After injection a medication may be designed to be released slowly called a depot injection which can produce long-lasting effects.An injection necessarily causes a small puncture wound to the body and thus may cause localized pain or infection. The occurrence of these side effects varies based on injection location the substance injected needle gauge procedure and individual sensitivity. Rarely more serious side effects including gangrene sepsis and nerve damage may occur. Fear of needles also called needle phobia is also common and may result in anxiety and fainting before during or after an injection. To prevent the localized pain that occurs with injections the injection site may be numbed or cooled before injection and the person receiving the injection may be distracted by a conversation or similar means. To reduce the risk of infection from injections proper aseptic technique should be followed to clean the injection site before administration. If needles or syringes are reused between people or if an accidental needlestick occurs there is a risk of transmission of bloodborne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis.Unsafe injection practices contribute to the spread of bloodborne diseases especially in less-developed countries. To combat this safety syringes exist which contain features to prevent accidental needlestick injury and reuse of the syringe after it is used once. Furthermore recreational drug users who use injections to administer the drugs commonly share or reuse needles after an injection. This has led to the development of needle exchange programs and safe injection sites as a public health measure which may provide new sterile syringes and needles to discourage the reuse of syringes and needles. Used needles should ideally be placed in a purpose-made sharps container which is safe and resistant to puncture. Some locations provide free disposal programs for such containers for their citizens."

It is used to treat various eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) diabetic retinopathy and infections inside the eye such as endophthalmitis. As compared to topical administration this method is beneficial for a more localized delivery of medications to the targeted site as the needle can directly pass through the anatomical eye barrier (e.g. cornea conjunctiva and lens) and dynamic barrier (e.g. tears and aqueous humor). It could also minimize adverse drug effects on other body tissues via the systemic circulation which could be a possible risk for intravenous injection of medications. Although there are risks of infections or other complications with suitable precautions throughout the injection process chances for these complications could be lowered."

In perspective the effects of the wrong use of substances that are capable of causing harm to the user or others have been extensively described in different studies using a variety of terms such as substance use problems problematic drugs or alcohol use and substance use disorder. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) states that \"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a treatable mental disorder that affects a person's brain and behavior leading to their inability to control their use of substances like legal or illegal drugs alcohol or medications. Symptoms can be moderate to severe with addiction being the most severe form of SUD\". Substance use disorders (SUD) are considered to be a serious mental illness that fluctuates with the age that symptoms first start appearing in an individual the time during which it exists and the type of substance that is used. It is not uncommon for those who have SUD to also have other mental health disorders. Substance use disorders are characterized by an array of mental/emotional physical and behavioral problems such as chronic guilt; an inability to reduce or stop consuming the substance(s) despite repeated attempts; operating vehicles while intoxicated; and physiological withdrawal symptoms. Drug classes that are commonly involved in SUD include: alcohol (alcoholism); cannabis; opioids; stimulants such as nicotine (including tobacco) cocaine and amphetamines; benzodiazepines; barbiturates; and other substances.In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (2013) also known as DSM-5 the DSM-IV diagnoses of substance abuse and substance dependence were merged into the category of substance use disorders. The severity of substance use disorders can vary widely; in the DSM-5 diagnosis of a SUD the severity of an individual's SUD is qualified as mild moderate or severe on the basis of how many of the 11 diagnostic criteria are met. The International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11) divides substance use disorders into two categories: (1) harmful pattern of substance use; and (2) substance dependence.In 2017 globally 271 million people (5.5% of adults) were estimated to have used one or more illicit drugs. Of these 35 million had a substance use disorder. An additional 237 million men and 46 million women have alcohol use disorder as of 2016. In 2017 substance use disorders from illicit substances directly resulted in 585000 deaths. Direct deaths from drug use other than alcohol have increased over 60 percent from 2000 to 2015. Alcohol use resulted in an additional 3 million deaths in 2016."

        "article": "Supervised injection sites (SIS) or drug consumption rooms (DCRs) are a health and social response to drug-related problems. They are fixed or mobile spaces where people who use drugs are provided with sterile drug use equipment and can use illicit drugs under the supervision of trained staff. They are usually located in areas where there is an open drug scene and where injecting in public places is common. The primary target group for DCR services are people who engage in risky drug use.The geographical distribution of DCRs is uneven both at the international and regional levels. In 2022 there were over 100 DCRs operating globally with services in Belgium Denmark France Germany Greece Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Portugal and Spain as well as in Switzerland Australia Canada Mexico and the USA. Primarily DCRs aim to prevent drug-related overdose deaths reduce the acute risks of disease transmission through unhygienic injecting and connect people who use drugs with addiction treatment and other health and social services. They can also aim to minimise public nuisance. Proponents say they save lives and connect users to services while opponents believe they promote drug use and attract crime to the community around the site.  Supervised injection sites are part of a harm reduction approach towards drug problems."

        "article": "Betaxolol is a selective beta1 receptor blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and angina. It is also a adrenergic blocker with no partial agonist action and minimal membrane stabilizing activity. Being selective for beta1 receptors it typically has fewer systemic side effects than non-selective beta-blockers for example not causing bronchospasm (mediated by beta2 receptors) as timolol may. Betaxolol also shows greater affinity for beta1 receptors than metoprolol. In addition to its effect on the heart betaxolol reduces the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure). This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the aqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to glaucoma. It was patented in 1975 and approved for medical use in 1983."

They are herbs that are annual or biennial or perennial in life span. Some species have a woody base. For the most part they have small white to yellow-white colored flowers that are often hidden within the paired bracts.The genus Siphonychia has been incorporated into Paronychia by botanists.The common names for some of the species include chickweed nailwort and Whitlow-wort. The genus gets its name from the disease of the fingernails which it was once thought to cure. Traditional healers in modern-day use species of this genus to treat kidney stones."

It is a plant of moist rocky habitat such as vernal pools. This is a petite plant producing a nearly invisible stem from a threadlike taproot. The plant is only about a centimeter wide and somewhat spherical in shape. It is a tiny patch of bristle-tipped green leaves a few millimeters in length with oval-shaped stipules.

        "article": "Paronychia chartacea is a rare species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae known by the common names papery Whitlow-wort and paper nailwort. It is endemic to Florida in the United States. There are two subspecies of the plant; ssp. chartacea occurs in Central Florida especially the Lake Wales Ridge and ssp. minima is native to the Florida Panhandle. The two subspecies are geographically separated and do not occur together. Both are included on the federal Endangered Species List on which the species is designated threatened.This is often an annual herb though ssp. chartacea may be a short-lived perennial. It produces a short spreading stem that branches many times to take on a mat-like form. The stem is no more than 20 centimeters long. It is lined with occasional small leathery leaves which are oblong to triangular in form and just a few millimeters long. The ends of the forking stem branches are dense highly divided cymes of many tiny flowers. The flowers generally have five sepals stamens and other parts but they may have 3 or 4 parts a trait unique among the North American Paronychia species. The sepals are brownish or purplish fading to  thinned papery whitish or translucent edges. The fruit is a minute utricle measuring half a millimeter long. The two subspecies differ in size; ssp. minima has a smaller caudex and smaller inflorescences.This plant grows in small openings in the Florida scrub where it is an early successional species likely increasing in number after wildfire clears an overgrown area. It grows in white sand scrub. The Central Florida subspecies ssp. chartacea occurs in open areas dominated by rosemary and sand pine sometimes colonizing recently disturbed habitat. Other plants and lichens in the area include Bonamia grandiflora Hypericum cumulicola Polygonella basaramia Cladonia perforata Eryngium cuneifolium and Liatris ohlingerae. The northern subspecies ssp. minima occurs in the white sand edges of ponds and sinkholes in karst substrate. It is present in Bay and Washington Counties. Though limited in distribution and threatened by the loss of its natural ecosystem the plant can be locally common in fragments of remaining habitat.The main threat to the species is the destruction and degradation of the Florida scrub. This type of habitat is being consumed for development and conversion to agriculture such as new citrus groves. Remaining strips of scrub are degraded in quality because of fire suppression. The scrub depends on periodic wildfire for its maintenance; without a normal fire regime it becomes overgrown and experiences succession during which the herb layer is outcompeted and shaded out by larger and woody vegetation and the open sunny scrub becomes a forest. Some remaining scrub is managed properly to prevent this succession and it is here that rare herbs such as the nailwort persist. It is one of many rare local endemic plants that survive on the Lake Wales Ridge part of which is protected and stewarded. Protected areas are located in Highlands Polk Lake and Orange Counties."

        "article": "This list of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names is intended to help those unfamiliar with classical languages to understand and remember the scientific names of organisms. The binomial nomenclature used for animals and plants is largely derived from Latin and Greek words as are some of the names used for higher taxa such as orders and above. At the time when biologist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) published the books that are now accepted as the starting point of binomial nomenclature Latin was used in Western Europe as the common language of science and scientific names were in Latin or Greek: Linnaeus continued this practice.While learning Latin is now less common it is still used by classical scholars and for certain purposes in botany medicine and the Roman Catholic Church and it can still be found in scientific names. It is helpful to be able to understand the source of scientific names. Although the Latin names do not always correspond to the current English common names they are often related and if their meanings are understood they are easier to recall. The binomial name often reflects limited knowledge or hearsay about a species at the time it was named. For instance Pan troglodytes the chimpanzee and Troglodytes troglodytes the wren are not necessarily cave-dwellers.Sometimes a genus name or specific descriptor is simply the Latin or Greek name for the animal (e.g. Canis is Latin for dog). These words may not be included in the table below if they only occur for one or two taxa. Instead the words listed below are the common adjectives and other modifiers that repeatedly occur in the scientific names of many organisms (in more than one genus).Adjectives vary according to gender and in most cases only the lemma form (nominative singular masculine form) is listed here. 1st-and-2nd-declension adjectives end in -us (masculine) -a (feminine) and -um (neuter) whereas 3rd-declension adjectives ending in -is (masculine and feminine) change to -e (neuter). For example verus is listed without the variants for Aloe vera or Galium verum.The second part of a binomial is often a person's name in the genitive case ending -i (masculine) or -ae (feminine) such as Kaempfer's tody-tyrant Hemitriccus kaempferi. The name may be converted into a Latinised form first giving -ii and -iae instead.Words that are very similar to their English forms have been omitted.Some of the Greek transliterations given are Ancient Greek and others are Modern Greek.In the tables L = Latin G = Greek and LG = similar in both languages."

The mushroom is commonly known as the devil's cigar or the Texas star in the United States while in Japan it is called kirinomitake (\u30ad\u30ea\u30ce\u30df\u30bf\u30b1).This extremely rare mushroom is notable for its unusual appearance and disjunct distribution; it is found only in select locales in Texas and Japan. The fruit body which grows on the stumps or dead roots of cedar elms (in Texas) or dead oaks (in Japan) somewhat resembles a dark brown or black cigar before it splits open radially into a starlike arrangement of four to seven leathery rays. The interior surface of the fruit body bears the spore-bearing tissue known as the hymenium and is colored white to brown depending on its age. The fruit body opening can be accompanied by a distinct hissing sound and the release of a smoky cloud of spores.Fruit bodies were first collected in Austin Texas and the species was named Urnula geaster in 1893; later it was found in Kyushu in 1937 but the mushroom was not reported again in Japan until 1973. Although the new genus Chorioactis was proposed to accommodate the unique species a few years after its original discovery  it was not  accepted as a valid genus until 1968. Its classification has also been a source of confusion. Historically Chorioactis was placed in the fungus family Sarcosomataceae despite inconsistencies in the microscopic structure of the ascus the saclike structure in which spores are formed. Phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have clarified the fungus's classification: Chorioactis along with three other genera make up the family Chorioactidaceae a grouping of related fungi formally acknowledged in 2008. In 2009 Japanese researchers reported discovering a form of the fungus missing the sexual stage of its lifecycle; this asexual state was named Kumanasamuha geaster."

Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; humans and many other animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Consequently fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.In common language usage fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state such as apples bananas grapes lemons oranges and strawberries. In botanical usage the term fruit also includes many structures that are not commonly called 'fruits' in everyday language such as nuts bean pods corn kernels tomatoes and wheat grains."

This entry mainly deals with the superior SCDS.The superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SSCDS) is a set of hearing and balance symptoms that a rare disease/disorder of the inner ear's superior semicircular canal/duct induces.  The symptoms are caused by a thinning or complete absence of the part of the temporal bone overlying the superior semicircular canal of the vestibular system. There is evidence that this rare defect or susceptibility is congenital. There are also numerous cases of symptoms arising after physical trauma to the head. It was first described in 1998 by Lloyd B. Minor of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore."

        "article": "The vaginal cuff is the upper portion of the vagina that opens up into the peritoneum and is sutured shut after the removal of the cervix and uterus during a hysterectomy.  The vaginal cuff is created by suturing together the edges of the surgical site where the cervix was attached to the vagina. This is accomplished by bringing the edges of the vagina together and suturing them together and to the uterosacral ligaments to prevent prolapse. The peritoneum is also sewn into the newly created vaginal cuff. There may be an advantage to using one method of closure over another. The vaginal cuff has a tendency to partially or completely dehisce or open up. A further complication that can accompany the dehiscence of the vaginal cuff is evisceration or the movement of intestines into the vagina. Some or all of the vaginal cuff can reopen.The risk of vaginal cuff complications is related to the approach to hysterectomy: robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy total laparoscopic hysterectomy laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy total abdominal hysterectomy and total vaginal hysterectomy.The vaginal cuff can be stressed by sexual intercourse chronic constipation asthma COPD and other actions that increase intra-abdominal pressure. This structure is prone to infection hematoma and other postoperative complications. Factors that are thought to affect wound healing are radiation treatments age pelvic organ prolapse the use of corticosteroids concurrent malignancy.Though rare estimates of the prevalence of vaginal cuff dehiscence after hysterectomy are estimated and reported to be between 0.14 and 4.1% per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). If the vaginal cuff is compromised vaginal evisceration can occur with the small intestine protruding out through the vagina."

Some CVBDs are of zoonotic concern.Many CVBD are transmissible to humans as well as companion animals. Some CVBD are fatal; most can only be controlled not cured. Therefore infection should be avoided by preventing arthropod vectors from feeding on the blood of their preferred hosts. While it is well known that arthropods transmit bacteria and protozoa during blood feeds viruses are also becoming recognized as another group of transmitted pathogens of both animals and humans.Some canine vector-borne pathogens of major zoonotic concern are found worldwide while others are localized by continent. Listed by vector some such pathogens and their associated diseases are the following:Phlebotomine sandflies (Psychodidae):Leishmania amazonensis L. colombiensis and L. infantum cause visceral leishmaniasis (see also canine leishmaniasis).L. braziliensis causes mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.L. tropica causes cutaneous leishmaniasis.L. peruviana and L. major cause localized cutaneous leishmaniasis.Triatomine bugs (Reduviidae):Trypanosoma cruzi causes trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease).Ticks (Ixodidae):Babesia canis subspecies (Babesia canis canis B. canis vogeli B. canis rossi and B. canis gibsoni) cause babesiosis.Ehrlichia canis and E. chaffeensis cause monocytic ehrlichiosis.Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes granulocytic anaplasmosis.Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease.Rickettsia rickettsii causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Rickettsia conorii causes Mediterranean spotted fever.Mosquitoes (Culicidae):Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens cause dirofilariasis.Other parasites:Toxocara canisEchinococcus"

        "article": "Arthropods are common vectors of disease. A vector is an organism which spreads disease-causing parasites or pathogens from one host to another. Invertebrates spread bacterial viral and protozoan pathogens by two main mechanisms. Either via their bite as in the case of malaria spread by mosquitoes or via their faeces as in the case of Chagas' Disease spread by Triatoma bugs or epidemic typhus spread by human body lice.Many invertebrates are responsible for transmitting diseases. Mosquitoes are perhaps the best known invertebrate vector and transmit a wide range of tropical diseases including malaria dengue fever and yellow fever. Another large group of vectors are flies. Sandfly species transmit the disease leishmaniasis by acting as vectors for protozoan Leishmania species and tsetse flies transmit protozoan trypansomes (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypansoma brucei rhodesiense) which cause African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ticks and lice form another large group of invertebrate vectors. The bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme Disease is transmitted by ticks and members of the bacterial genus Rickettsia are transmitted by lice. For example the human body louse transmits the bacterium Rickettsia prowazekii which causes epidemic typhus.Although invertebrate-transmitted diseases pose a particular threat on the continents of Africa Asia and South America there is one way of controlling invertebrate-borne diseases which is by controlling the invertebrate vector. For example one way of controlling malaria is to control the mosquito vector through the use of mosquito nets which prevent mosquitoes from coming into contact with humans."

        "article": "Peptic ulcer disease is a break in the inner lining of the stomach the first part of the small intestine or sometimes the lower esophagus. An ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer while one in the first part of the intestines is a duodenal ulcer. The most common symptoms of a duodenal ulcer are waking at night with upper abdominal pain and upper abdominal pain that improves with eating. With a gastric ulcer the pain may worsen with eating. The pain is often described as a burning or dull ache. Other symptoms include belching vomiting weight loss or poor appetite. About a third of older people with peptic ulcers have no symptoms. Complications may include bleeding perforation and blockage of the stomach. Bleeding occurs in as many as 15% of cases.Common causes include infection with Helicobacter pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Other less common causes include tobacco smoking stress as a result of other serious health conditions Beh\u00e7et's disease Zollinger\u2013Ellison syndrome Crohn's disease and liver cirrhosis. Older people are more sensitive to the ulcer-causing effects of NSAIDs. The diagnosis is typically suspected due to the presenting symptoms with confirmation by either endoscopy or barium swallow. H. pylori can be diagnosed by testing the blood for antibodies a urea breath test testing the stool for signs of the bacteria or a biopsy of the stomach. Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include stomach cancer coronary heart disease and inflammation of the stomach lining or gallbladder inflammation.Diet does not play an important role in either causing or preventing ulcers. Treatment includes stopping smoking stopping use of NSAIDs stopping alcohol and taking medications to decrease stomach acid. The medication used to decrease acid is usually either a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or an H2 blocker with four weeks of treatment initially recommended. Ulcers due to H. pylori are treated with a combination of medications such as amoxicillin clarithromycin and a PPI. Antibiotic resistance is increasing and thus treatment may not always be effective. Bleeding ulcers may be treated by endoscopy with open surgery typically only used in cases in which it is not successful.Peptic ulcers are present in around 4% of the population. New ulcers were found in around 87.4 million people worldwide during 2015. About 10% of people develop a peptic ulcer at some point in their life. Peptic ulcers resulted in 267500 deaths in 2015 down from 327000 in 1990. The first description of a perforated peptic ulcer was in 1670 in Princess Henrietta of England. H. pylori was first identified as causing peptic ulcers by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren in the late 20th century a discovery for which they received the Nobel Prize in 2005."

        "article": "Pressure ulcers also known as pressure sores bed sores or pressure injuries are localised damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue that usually occur over a bony prominence as a result of usually long-term pressure or pressure in combination with shear or friction. The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum coccyx heels and hips though other sites can be affected such as the elbows knees ankles back of shoulders or the back of the cranium.Pressure ulcers occur due to pressure applied to soft tissue resulting in completely or partially obstructed blood flow to the soft tissue. Shear is also a cause as it can pull on blood vessels that feed the skin. Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in individuals who are not moving about such as those who are on chronic bedrest or consistently use a wheelchair. It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development. These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition microclimate (skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence) diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin such as arteriosclerosis or diseases that reduce the sensation in the skin such as paralysis or neuropathy. The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person medical conditions (such as arteriosclerosis diabetes or infection) smoking or medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs.Although often prevented and treatable if detected early pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill people frail elders and individuals with impaired mobility such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved). Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person. The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century. In addition to turning and re-positioning the person in the bed or wheelchair eating a balanced diet with adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is important.The rate of pressure ulcers in hospital settings is high; the prevalence in European hospitals ranges from 8.3% to 23% and the prevalence was 26% in Canadian healthcare settings from 1990 to 2003. In 2013 there were 29000 documented deaths from pressure ulcers globally up from 14000 deaths in 1990.The United States has tracked rates of pressure injury since the early 2000s. Whittington and Briones reported nationwide rates of pressure injuries in hospitals of 6% to 8%. By the early 2010s Lyder and colleagues had research the rate of pressure injury to drop to about 4.5% across the Medicare population following the introduction of the International Guideline for pressure injury prevention. Padula and colleagues have witnessed a +29% uptick in pressure injury rates in recent years associated with the rollout of penalizing Medicare policies."

It may also be spread by drinking contaminated water or breathing in contaminated dust. It does not spread directly between people. Diagnosis is by blood tests or cultures of the infected site.Prevention is by using insect repellent wearing long pants rapidly removing ticks and not disturbing dead animals. Treatment is typically with the antibiotic streptomycin. Gentamicin doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may also be used.Between the 1970s and 2015 around 200 cases were reported in the United States a year. Males are affected more often than females. It occurs most frequently in the young and the middle aged. In the United States most cases occur in the summer.

Sclerodactyly is often preceded by months or even years by Raynaud's phenomenon when it is part of systemic scleroderma.The term \"sclerodactyly\" comes from the combination of the Greek words \"skleros\" meaning hard and \"daktylos\" meaning a finger or toe \u2013 \"hard fingers or toes\".It is generally associated with systemic scleroderma and mixed connective tissue disease and auto-immune disorders.Sclerodactyly is one component of the limited cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) also known as CREST syndrome (CREST is an acronym that stands for calcinosis Raynaud's phenomenon esophageal dysmotility sclerodactyly and telangiectasia.) Sclerodactyly is also one component of Huriez Syndrome along with palmoplantar keratoderma and skin cancer. Sclerodactyly sometimes arises as a complication of the microvascular changes seen in diabetes mellitus and is in this case referred to as diabetic sclerodactyly.Treatment of sclerodactyly is by physical therapy phototherapy surgery topical corticosteroids or vitamin D analogues and systemic immunosuppressive drugs when the condition is part of systemic scleroderma. Localized treatment won't halt systemic disease but can restore function and cosmetic aspects of the affected digits. The mild to moderate proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion and extension contractures and stiff distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in slight flexion often seen in sclerodactyly can be addressed somewhat with physical therapy. In a few cases when immune involvement isn't apparent (in these cases environmental causes are suspected) the condition may gradually clear up by itself If the trigger is avoided. In other cases early treatment while the disease is in the inflammatory stage is much more likely to be successful than on established lesions."

Four serotypes of the virus have been found and a reported fifth has yet to be confirmed all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease. Nevertheless scientists' understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic as rather than distinct antigenic groups a continuum appears to exist.  This same study identified 47 strains of dengue virus.  Additionally coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for Zika virus and chikungunya complicate matters in real-world infections.Dengue virus has increased dramatically within the last 20 years becoming one of the worst mosquito-borne human pathogens that tropical countries have to deal with. Current estimates indicate that as many as 390 million infections occur each year and many dengue infections are increasingly understood to be asymptomatic or subclinical."

They are composed of an O-antigen an outer core and an inner core all joined by covalent bonds and are found in the bacterial capsule the outermost membrane of cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Today the term endotoxin is often used synonymously with LPS although there are a few endotoxins (in the original sense of toxins that are inside the bacterial cell that are released when the cell disintegrates) that are not related to LPS such as the so-called delta endotoxin proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis.Lipopolysaccharides can have substantial impacts on human health primarily through interactions with the immune system. LPS is a potent activator of the immune system and pyrogen (agent that causes fever). In severe cases LPS can play a role in causing septic shock. In lower levels and over a longer time period there is evidence LPS may play an important and harmful role in autoimmunity obesity depression and cellular senescence."

        "article": "A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is one of a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and as a result do not develop into healthy blood cells. Early on no symptoms typically are seen. Later symptoms may include fatigue shortness of breath bleeding disorders anemia or frequent infections. Some types may develop into acute myeloid leukemia.Risk factors include previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy exposure to certain chemicals such as tobacco smoke pesticides and benzene and exposure to heavy metals such as mercury or lead. Problems with blood cell formation result in some combination of low red blood cell platelet and white blood cell counts. Some types of MDS cause an increase in the production of immature blood cells (called blasts) in the bone marrow or blood. The different types of MDS are identified based on the specific characteristics of the changes in the blood cells and bone marrow.Treatments may include supportive care drug therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Supportive care may include blood transfusions medications to increase the making of red blood cells and antibiotics. Drug therapy may include the medications lenalidomide antithymocyte globulin and azacitidine. Some people can be cured by chemotherapy followed by a stem-cell transplant from a donor.About seven per 100000 people are affected by MDS; about four per 100000 people newly acquire  the condition each year. The typical age of onset is 70 years. The prognosis depends on the type of cells affected the number of blasts in the bone marrow or blood and the changes present in the chromosomes of the affected cells. The average survival time following diagnosis is 2.5 years. MDS was first recognized in the early 1900s; it came to be called myelodysplastic syndrome in 1976."

It is one of the most commonly used suicide methods and has a high mortality rate; Gunnell et al. gives a figure of at least 70 percent. The materials required are easily available making it a difficult method to prevent. In the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems suicides by hanging are classified under the code X70: \"Intentional self-harm by hanging strangulation and suffocation.\"Hanging is divided into suspension hanging and the much rarer drop hanging\u2060\u2009\u2060\u2014\u2009the latter can kill in various ways. People who survive either because the cord or its anchor point of attachment breaks or because they are discovered and cut down can face a range of serious injuries including cerebral anoxia (which can lead to permanent brain damage) laryngeal fracture cervical spine fracture tracheal fracture pharyngeal laceration and carotid artery injury. Ron M. Brown writes that hanging has a \"fairly imperspicuous and complicated symbolic history\". There are commentaries on hanging in antiquity and it has various cultural interpretations. Throughout history numerous famous people have died due to suicide by hanging."

The condition is part of a larger group of thiamine deficiency disorders that includes beriberi in all its forms and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. When it occurs simultaneously with alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome it is known as Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome.Classically Wernicke encephalopathy is characterised by a triad of symptoms: ophthalmoplegia ataxia and confusion. Around 10% of patients exhibit all three features and other symptoms may also be present. While it is commonly regarded as a condition peculiar to malnourished people with alcohol misuse it can be caused by a variety of diseases.It is treated with thiamine supplementation which can lead to improvement of the symptoms and often complete resolution particularly in those where alcohol misuse is not the underlying cause. Often other nutrients also need to be replaced depending on the cause. Medical literature notes how managing the condition in a timely fashion can avoid worsening symptoms.Wernicke encephalopathy may be present in the general population with a prevalence of around 2% and is considered underdiagnosed; probably many cases are in patients who do not have commonly-associated symptoms."

Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical intellectual or developmental. The disabilities can range from mild to severe. Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders. Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders.Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders exposure to certain medications or chemicals or certain infections during pregnancy. Risk factors include folate deficiency drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy poorly controlled diabetes and a mother over the age of 35 years old. Many are believed to involve multiple factors. Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests. A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests.Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. This may include therapy medication surgery or assistive technology. Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015. In the United States they occur in about 3% of newborns. They resulted in about 628000 deaths in 2015 down from 751000 in 1990. The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303000) followed by neural tube defects (65000)."

The aphids form galls and act as colony defenders at times sacrificing their own lives to do so. It has been shown that colony defense is more likely in habitats that are difficult to obtain and can hold a large number of individuals. These gall locations are crucial because plants have a short window in which a gall can be produced. Thus it is important for there to be a defense system that enables the aphids to retain their galls. The need for defense arises when the gall is opened up to allow winged aphid migrants to leave and to release any waste. The process of repairing the holes can take up to 10 days; during this time the gall is susceptible to intruding predators."

In Rome he became friends with the cardinal Giordano Orsini and the pope's secretary Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini who were among those working to update the old Roman cartography. Claudius contributed to a more realistic description of Nordic countries in particular Iceland and Greenland and was probably the first cartographer to put Greenland on a map. He is also known for having named Greenlandic places by using lyrics from old folk songs.Most of his work (including two maps) is  lost but a copy has been preserved through the German cartographers Donnus Nicholas Germanus and Henricus Martellus Germanus and in the nineteenth century more texts were rediscovered in the imperial library at Vienna.

When on the feet corns can be so painful as to interfere with walking. The visible portion of the corn tends to be more-or-less round but corns are defined by having a hard tapering root that is directed inward and pressure on the corn pushes this root deeper into the flesh (thus the Latin Latin: clavus meaning \"nail\".) Pressure corns usually occur on thin or glabrous (hairless and smooth) skin surfaces especially on the dorsal surface of toes or fingers but corns triggered by an acute injury (such as a thorn) may occur on the thicker skin of the palms (palmar corns) or bottom of the feet (plantar corns).Pressure corns form when chronic pressure on the skin against an underlying bone traces a usually elliptical path during the rubbing motion. The corn forms at the center of the pressure point and gradually widens and deepens.Corns from an acute injury such as from a thorn in the sole of the foot may form due to the weight of the body when the process that creates the usually evenly developing plantar callus is concentrated at the point of the healing injury as an internal callus may be triggered by pressure on the transitional scar tissue. Once formed the corn itself becomes the pressure point that generates the callus. Plantar corns have appearance superficially similar to plantar warts but the cause and treatment are very different."

It was once misidentified as the heaviest bony fish which was actually a different and closely related species of sunfish Mola alexandrini. Adults typically weigh between 247 and 1000\u00a0kg (545 and 2205\u00a0lb).  It is native to tropical and temperate waters around the world. It resembles a fish head without a tail and its main body is flattened laterally. Sunfish can be as tall as they are long when their dorsal and ventral fins are extended.Adult sunfish are vulnerable to few natural predators but sea lions killer whales and sharks will consume them. Sunfish are considered a delicacy in some parts of the world including Japan Korea and Taiwan. In the European Union regulations ban the sale of fish and fishery products derived from the family Molidae. Sunfish are frequently caught in gillnets."

        "article": "Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is life-threatening leukemia in which malignant megakaryoblasts proliferate abnormally and injure various tissues. Megakaryoblasts are the most immature precursor cells in a platelet-forming lineage; they mature to promegakaryocytes and ultimately megakaryocytes which cells shed membrane-enclosed particles i.e. platelets into the circulation. Platelets are critical for the normal clotting of blood. While malignant megakaryoblasts usually are the predominant proliferating and tissue-damaging cells their similarly malignant descendants promegakaryocytes and megakaryocytes are variable contributors to the malignancy.AMKL is commonly regarded as a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). More formally it is classified under the AML-M7 category of the French-American-British classification and by the World Health Organization of 2016 in the AML-Not Otherwise Specified subcategory.Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia falls into three distinct groups which differ in underlying causes ages of presentation responses to therapy and prognoses. These groups are: AMKL occurring in young children with Down syndrome i.e. DS-AMKL; AMKL occurring in children who do not have Down syndrome i.e. non-DS-AMKL (also termed pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia or pediatric AMKL); and AMKL occurring in non-DS adults i.e. adult-AMKL. AMKL while rare is the most common form of AML in DS-AMKL occurring ~500-fold more commonly in Down syndrome children than in children without Down syndrome; non-DS-AMKL and adult-AMLK are rare accounting for &lt;1% of all individuals diagnosed as in the AML-M7 category of leukemia."

        "article": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired shortness of breath easy bruising and bleeding and increased risk of infection. Occasionally spread may occur to the brain skin or gums. As an acute leukemia AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.Risk factors include smoking previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy myelodysplastic syndrome and exposure to the chemical benzene. The underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells which results in a drop in red blood cells platelets and normal white blood cells. Diagnosis is generally based on bone marrow aspiration and specific blood tests. AML has several subtypes for which treatments and outcomes may vary.The first-line treatment of AML is usually chemotherapy with the aim of inducing remission. People may then go on to receive additional chemotherapy radiation therapy or a stem cell transplant. The specific genetic mutations present within the cancer cells may guide therapy as well as determine how long that person is likely to survive.In 2015 AML affected about one million people and resulted in 147000 deaths globally. It most commonly occurs in older adults. Males are affected more often than females. The five-year survival rate is about 35% in people under 60 years old and 10% in people over 60 years old. Older people whose health is too poor for intensive chemotherapy have a typical survival of five to ten months. It accounts for roughly 1.1% of all cancer cases and 1.9% of cancer deaths in the United States."

The presence of Dennie\u2013Morgan folds can be used as a diagnostic marker for allergy with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 76% for atopic dermatitis according to one study although another study found them to be of diagnostic significance in atopic dermatitis. The condition was described by Charles Clayton Dennie and David B. Morgan in 1948. The pathophysiology of this sign is not clear. One proposed mechanism is that continuous spasm of the superior tarsal muscle and skin edema could be due to hypoxia from poor circulation.A Dennie\u2013Morgan fold should not be confused with an \"allergic shiner\" which is a purple-gray discoloration with associated fullness beneath the lower eyelid.

Diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical examination findings and confirmed by serial neuroimaging (computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging).The treatment of cerebral edema depends on the cause and includes monitoring of the person's airway and intracranial pressure proper positioning controlled hyperventilation medications fluid management steroids. Extensive cerebral edema can also be treated surgically with a decompressive craniectomy. Cerebral edema is a major cause of brain damage and contributes significantly to the mortality of ischemic strokes and traumatic brain injuries.As cerebral edema is present with many common cerebral pathologies the epidemiology of the disease is not easily defined. The incidence of this disorder should be considered in terms of its potential causes and is present in most cases of traumatic brain injury central nervous system tumors brain ischemia and intracerebral hemorrhage. For example malignant brain edema was present in roughly 31% of people with ischemic strokes within 30 days after onset."

The underwater diver relies on various items of diving and support equipment to stay alive healthy and reasonably  comfortable and to perform planned tasks during a dive.Divers vary considerably in anthropometric dimensions physical strength joint flexibility and other factors. Diving equipment should be versatile and chosen to fit the diver the environment and the task. How well the overall design achieves a fit between equipment and diver can strongly influence its functionality. Diving support equipment is usually shared by a wide range of divers and must work for them all. When correct operation of equipment is critical to diver safety it is desirable that different makes and models should work similarly to facilitate rapid familiarisation with new equipment. When this is not possible additional training for the required skills may be necessary.The most difficult stages for recreational divers are out of water activities and transitions between the water and the surface site such as carrying equipment on shore exiting from water to boat and shore swimming on the surface and putting on equipment. Safety and reliability adjustability to fit the individual performance and simplicity were rated the most important features for diving equipment by recreational divers.The professional diver is supported by a surface team who are available to assist with the out-of-water activities to the extent necessary to reduce the risk associated with them to a level acceptable in terms of the governing occupational safety and health      regulations and codes of practice. This tends to make professional diving more expensive and the cost tends to be passed on to the client."

This plant disease is found wherever these vegetables are grown.Common scab symptoms are variable and can range from surface russeting to deep pits in root and tuber vegetables. This disease does not usually affect yields but it can greatly reduce quality of the harvested vegetables and make them unsuitable for sale.Root and tuber vegetables are susceptible to infection by Streptomyces species as soon as the root or tuber forms but because this disease only affects root and tubers the symptoms are not usually noted until harvest. Dry soils increase disease incidence and severity therefore proper irrigation can aid in control of this disease. Common scab is suppressed if the soil pH is lower than 5.2 although scab lesions may still form in low pH soils due to physiological stresses or S.\u00a0acidiscabies."

The term \u2018eschar\u2019 is not interchangeable with \u2018scab\u2019. An eschar contains necrotic tissue whereas a scab is composed of dried blood and exudate.Black eschars are most frequently attributed in medicine to cutaneous anthrax (infection by Bacillus anthracis) which may be contracted through herd animal exposure and also from Pasteurella multocida exposure in cats and rabbits. A newly identified human rickettsial infection R. parkeri rickettsiosis can be differentiated from Rocky Mountain spotted fever by the presence of an eschar at the site of inoculation. Eschar is sometimes called a black wound because the wound is covered with thick dry black necrotic tissue.Eschar may be allowed to slough off naturally or it may require surgical removal (debridement) to prevent infection especially in immunocompromised patients (e.g. if a skin graft is to be conducted).If eschar is on a limb it is important to assess peripheral pulses of the affected limb to make sure blood and lymphatic circulation is not compromised.  If circulation is compromised an escharotomy or surgical incision through the eschar may be indicated."

        "article": "In the English language nigger is a racial slur directed at black people. Starting in the 1990s references to nigger have been increasingly replaced by the euphemism \"the N-word\" notably in cases where nigger is mentioned but not directly used. In an instance of linguistic reappropriation the term nigger is also used casually and fraternally among African Americans most commonly in the form of nigga whose spelling originated from the phonological system of African-American English.The origin of the word lies with the Latin adjective niger ([\u02c8n\u026a\u0261\u025br]) meaning \"black\". It was initially seen as a relatively neutral term essentially synonymous with the English word negro. Early attested uses during the Atlantic slave trade (16th\u201319th century) often conveyed a merely patronizing attitude. The word took on a derogatory connotation from the mid-18th century onward and \"degenerated into an overt slur\" by the middle of the 19th century. Some authors still used the term in a neutral sense up until the later part of the 20th century at which point the use of nigger became increasingly controversial regardless of its context or intent.Because the word nigger has historically \"wreaked symbolic violence often accompanied by physical violence\" it began to disappear from general popular culture from the second part of the 20th century onward with the exception of cases derived from intra-group usage such as hip hop culture. The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary describes the term as \"perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English\". The Oxford English Dictionary writes that \"this word is one of the most controversial in English and is liable to be considered offensive or taboo in almost all contexts (even when used as a self-description)\". Intra-group usage has been criticized by some contemporary Black American authors a group of them (the eradicationists) calling for the total abandonment of its usage (even under the variant nigga) which they see as contributing to the \"construction of an identity founded on self-hate\". In wider society the inclusion of the word nigger in classic works of literature (as in Mark Twain's 1884 book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) and in more recent cultural productions (such as Quentin Tarantino's 1994 film Pulp Fiction and 2012 film Django Unchained) has sparked controversy and ongoing debate.The word nigger has also been historically used to designate \"any person considered to be of low social status\" (as in the expression white nigger) or \"any person whose behavior is regarded as reprehensible\". In some cases with awareness of the word's offensive connotation but without intention to cause offense it can refer to a \"a victim of prejudice likened to that endured by African Americans\" (as in John Lennon's 1972 song \"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\")."

Symptoms of powdery scab include small lesions in the early stages of the disease progressing to raised pustules containing a powdery mass. These can eventually rupture within the tuber periderm. The powdery pustules contain resting spores that release anisokont zoospores (asexual spore with two unequal length flagella) to infect the root hairs of potatoes or tomatoes. Powdery scab is a cosmetic defect on tubers which can result in the rejection of these potatoes.  Potatoes which have been infected can be peeled to remove the infected skin and the remaining inside of the potato can be cooked and eaten."

A protein specific to chylomicrons is ApoB48.There is an inverse relationship in the density and size of lipoprotein particles: fats have a lower density than water or smaller protein molecules and the larger particles have a higher ratio of internal fat molecules with respect to the outer emulsifying protein molecules in the shell. ULDLs if in the region of 1000\u00a0nm or more are the only lipoprotein particles that can be seen using a light microscope at maximum magnification. All the other classes are submicroscopic."

Diabetic foot conditions can be acute or chronic complications of diabetes. Presence of several characteristic diabetic foot pathologies such as infection diabetic foot ulcer and neuropathic osteoarthropathy is called diabetic foot syndrome. The resulting bone deformity is known as Charcot foot.  Due to advanced peripheral nerve dysfunction associated with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) patients' feet have a dryness of the skin and a reduced ability to feel pain (nociception). Hence minor injuries may remain undiscovered and subsequently progress to a full-thickness diabetic foot ulcer. Moreover foot surgery is well tolerated without anaesthesia. The feet's insensivity to pain can easily be established by 512\u00a0mN quantitative pinprick stimulation.In diabetes peripheral nerve dysfunction can be combined with peripheral artery disease (PAD) causing poor blood circulation to the extremities (diabetic angiopathy). Around half of the patients with a diabetic foot ulcer have co-existing PAD. Vitamin D deficiency has been recently found to be associated with diabetic foot infections and increased risk of amputations and deaths.Research estimates that the lifetime incidence of foot ulcers within the diabetic community is around 15% and may become as high as 25%.Where wounds take a long time to heal infection may set in spreading to bones and joints and lower limb amputation may be necessary. Foot infection is the most common cause of non-traumatic amputation in people with diabetes."

Females with one copy of the mutated gene are carriers.X-linked inheritance means that the gene causing the trait or the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Carrier females who have only one copy of the mutation do not usually express the phenotype although differences in X-chromosome inactivation (known as skewed X-inactivation) can lead to varying degrees of clinical expression in carrier females since some cells will express one X allele and some will express the other.

However there is a subgroup of people who experience severe complications. The most well characterized are adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/Tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) both of which are only diagnosed in individuals testing positive to HTLV-1 infection. The estimated lifetime risk of ATL among people with HTLV-1 infection is approximately 5% while that of HAM/TSP is approximately 2%.In 1977 Adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) was first described in a case series of individuals from Japan. The symptoms of ATL were different from other lymphomas known at the time. The common birthplace shared amongst most of the ATL patients was suggestive of an infectious cause referred to as ATLV. Strikingly ATLV had the transforming activity in vitro. These studies established that HTLV-1 was the causitive agent of ATL. The retrovirus is now generally called HTLV-I because later studies proved that ATLV is the same as the firstly identified human retrovirus called HTLV discovered by Bernard Poiesz and Francis Ruscetti and their co-workers in the laboratory of Robert C. Gallo at the National Cancer Institute. Persistent lifelong infection is established when HTLV-1 integrates into the host genome as a provirus.  A patient infected with HTLV-1 can be diagnosed when antibodies against HTLV-1 are detected in the serum."

        "article": "Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia () With few exceptions animals consume organic material breathe oxygen have myocytes and are able to move can reproduce sexually and grow from a hollow sphere of cells the blastula during embryonic development. Animals form a clade meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor.Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described of which around 1.05 million are insects over 85000 are molluscs and around 65000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77\u00a0million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5\u00a0\u03bcm (0.00033\u00a0in) to 33.6\u00a0m (110\u00a0ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The vast majority belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes which includes organisms such as the arthropods molluscs flatworms annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes which include the echinoderms hemichordates and chordates the latter of which contains the vertebrates. The simple Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within Bilateria. Animals first appear in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran. Earlier evidence of animals is still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated all the way back to the Tonian period but its identity as an animal is heavily contested. Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion which began around 539\u00a0million years ago (Mya) and most classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4\u00a0Mya. 6331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650\u00a0Mya during the Cryogenian period.Historically Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874 Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques such as molecular phylogenetics which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat eggs and dairy products) for materials (such as leather fur and wool) as pets and as working animals for transportation and services. Dogs the first domesticated animal have been used in hunting in security and in warfare as have horses pigeons and birds of prey while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of human evolution having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times and are frequently featured in mythology religion arts literature heraldry politics and sports."

        "article": "Cnidaria ( ni-DAIR-ee-\u0259 NY-) is a phylum under kingdom Animalia containing over 11000 species of aquatic animals found both in fresh water and marine environments (predominantly the latter) including jellyfish hydroids sea anemones corals and some of the smallest marine parasites. Their distinguishing features are a decentralized nervous system distributed throughout a gelatinous body and the presence of cnidocytes or cnidoblasts specialized cells with ejectable flagella used mainly for envenomation and capturing prey. Their bodies consist of mesoglea a non-living jelly-like substance sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. Cnidarians are also some of the only animals that can reproduce both sexually and asexually.Cnidarians mostly have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes which are specialized stinging cells used to capture prey. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids or both (hence they are trimorphic). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Cnidarians also have Rhopalia which are involved in gravity sensing and sometimes chemoreception. Several free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually but many species have complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae stages. Some however omit either the polyp or the medusa stage and the parasitic classes evolved to have neither form.Cnidarians were formerly grouped with ctenophores also known as comb jellies in the phylum Coelenterata but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones corals sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish); Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa (a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms and which has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers (such as the Portuguese man o' war)). Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa and the highly derived parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were firmly recognized as cnidarians only in 2007.Most cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves but many obtain much of their nutrition from symbiotic dinoflagellates and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish sea slugs fish turtles and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals\u2014which form the structural foundation for coral reefs\u2014possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters other cnidarians can be found at great depths in polar regions and in freshwater.Cnidarians are a very ancient phylum with fossils having been found in rocks formed about 580\u00a0million years ago during the Ediacaran period preceding the Cambrian Explosion. Other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before 490\u00a0million years ago and diversified a few million years later. Molecular clock analysis of mitochondrial genes suggests an even older age for the crown group of cnidarians estimated around 741\u00a0million years ago almost 200 million years before the Cambrian period as well as before any fossils. Recent phylogenetic analyses support monophyly of cnidarians as well as the position of cnidarians as the sister group of bilaterians."

        "article": "Jellyfish also known as sea jellies are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile. The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion for efficient locomotion. The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle. The medusa is normally the sexual phase which produces planula larvae. These then disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase which may include asexual budding before reaching sexual maturity.Jellyfish are found all over the world from surface waters to the deep sea. Scyphozoans (the \"true jellyfish\") are exclusively marine but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in freshwater. Large often colorful jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. The medusae of most species are fast-growing and mature within a few months then die soon after breeding but the polyp stage attached to the seabed may be much more long-lived. Jellyfish have been in existence for at least 500 million years and possibly 700 million years or more making them the oldest multi-organ animal group.Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures. They are considered a delicacy in some Asian countries where species in the Rhizostomeae order are pressed and salted to remove excess water. Australian researchers have described them as a \"perfect food\": sustainable and protein-rich but relatively low in food energy.They are also used in research where the green fluorescent protein used by some species to cause bioluminescence has been adapted as a fluorescent marker for genes inserted into other cells or organisms.The stinging cells used by jellyfish to subdue their prey can injure humans. Thousands of swimmers worldwide are stung every year with effects ranging from mild discomfort to serious injury or even death. When conditions are favourable jellyfish can form vast swarms which can be responsible for damage to fishing gear by filling fishing nets and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea."

        "article": "Lidocaine also known as lignocaine and sold under the brand name Xylocaine among others is a local anesthetic of the amino amide type. It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia. When used for local anaesthesia or in nerve blocks lidocaine typically begins working within several minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area. It is often used mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) to prolong its local effects and to decrease bleeding.If injected intravenously it may cause cerebral effects such as confusion changes in vision numbness tingling and vomiting. It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. This means it works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When injected near nerves the nerves cannot conduct signals to or from the brain.Lidocaine was discovered in 1946 and went on sale in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021 it was the 267th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 1\u00a0million prescriptions."

Venomous animals actively deliver their toxins (called venom) into their target through a specially designed mechanism such as a bite or sting by using a venom apparatus such as fangs or a stinger in a processes called envenomation. They are often distinguished from poisonous animals which instead passively deliver their toxins (called poison) to their victims upon contact such as through inhalation absorption through the skin or after being ingested. The only difference between venomous animals and poisonous animals is how they deliver the toxins. This list deals exclusively with venomous animals.Venoms have adapted to serve a wide variety of purposes. Their intended effects can range from mild fleeting discomfort to paralysis and death and they may be highly selective in which species they target often making them harmless to all but a few specific organisms; what may be fatal to one species may be totally insignificant to another species.

In Greek pelagia means \"(she) of the sea\" from pelagos \"sea open sea\"; in Latin noctiluca is the combining form of nox \"night\"\" and lux \"light\"; thus Pelagia noctiluca can be described as a marine organism with the ability to glow in the dark (bioluminescence). It is found worldwide in tropical and warm temperate seas although it is suspected that records outside the North Atlantic region which includes the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico represent closely related but currently unrecognized species.A fairly small and variably coloured species both its tentacles and (unusual among jellyfish) bell are covered in stinging cells. Stinging incidents are common painful and the symptoms may continue for a considerable time after the encounter but they are generally not dangerous. When large numbers of this oceanic species are washed ashore the local economy can be affected because tourists avoid the beaches and fishers are stung while trying to retrieve their nets which can be clogged by the jellyfish. Additionally swarms of Pelagia noctiluca have been recorded wiping out entire fish farms. Because of this it has become one of the most studied jellyfish species."

The toxin is delivered through a specially evolved venom apparatus such as fangs or a stinger in a process called envenomation. Venom is often distinguished from poison which is a toxin that is passively delivered by being ingested inhaled or absorbed through the skin and toxungen which is actively transferred to the external surface of another animal via a physical delivery mechanism.Venom has evolved in terrestrial and marine environments and in a wide variety of animals: both predators and prey and both vertebrates and invertebrates. Venoms kill through the action of at least four major classes of toxin namely necrotoxins and cytotoxins which kill cells; neurotoxins which affect nervous systems; myotoxins which damage muscles; and haemotoxins which disrupt blood clotting. Venomous animals cause tens of thousands of human deaths per year.Venoms are often complex mixtures of toxins of differing types.  Toxins from venom are used to treat a wide range of medical conditions including thrombosis arthritis and some cancers. Studies in venomics are investigating the potential use of venom toxins for many other conditions."

Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form alkapton are excreted in the urine giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over 30 years old although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.Apart from treatment of the complications (such as pain relief and joint replacement for the cartilage damage) the drug nitisinone has been found to suppress homogentisic acid production and research is ongoing as to whether it can improve symptoms.

He is known as \"the father of modern pathology\" and as the founder of social medicine and to his colleagues the \"Pope of medicine\".Virchow studied medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University under Johannes Peter M\u00fcller. While working at the Charit\u00e9 hospital his investigation of the 1847\u20131848 typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia laid the foundation for public health in Germany and paved his political and social careers. From it he coined a well known aphorism: \"Medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale\". His participation in the Revolution of 1848 led to his expulsion from Charit\u00e9 the next year. He then published a newspaper Die Medizinische Reform (The Medical Reform). He took the first Chair of Pathological Anatomy at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in 1849. After seven years in 1856 Charit\u00e9 reinstated him to its new Institute for Pathology. He co-founded the political party Deutsche Fortschrittspartei and was elected to the Prussian House of Representatives and won a seat in the Reichstag. His opposition to Otto von Bismarck's financial policy resulted in duel challenge by the latter. However Virchow supported Bismarck in his anti-Catholic campaigns which he named Kulturkampf (\"culture struggle\").A prolific writer he produced more than 2000 scientific writings. Cellular Pathology (1858) regarded as the root of modern pathology introduced the third dictum in cell theory: Omnis cellula e cellula (\"All cells come from cells\") although this concept is now widely recognized as being plagiarized from Robert Remak.  He was a co-founder of Physikalisch-Medizinische Gesellschaft in 1849 and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Pathologie in 1897. He founded journals such as Archiv f\u00fcr Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr Klinische Medicin (with Benno Reinhardt in 1847 later renamed Virchows Archiv) and Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie (Journal of Ethnology). The latter is published by German Anthropological Association and the Berlin Society for Anthropology Ethnology and Prehistory the societies which he also founded.Virchow was the first to describe and name diseases such as leukemia chordoma ochronosis embolism and thrombosis. He coined biological terms such as \"neuroglia\" \"agenesis\" \"parenchyma\" \"osteoid\" \"amyloid degeneration\" and \"spina bifida\"; terms such as Virchow's node Virchow\u2013Robin spaces Virchow\u2013Seckel syndrome and Virchow's triad are named after him. His description of the life cycle of a roundworm Trichinella spiralis influenced the practice of meat inspection. He developed the first systematic method of autopsy and introduced hair analysis in forensic investigation. Opposing the germ theory of diseases he rejected Ignaz Semmelweis's idea of disinfecting. He was critical of what he described as \"Nordic mysticism\" regarding the Aryan race. As an anti-Darwinist he called Charles Darwin an \"ignoramus\" and his own student Ernst Haeckel a \"fool\". He described the original specimen of Neanderthal man as nothing but that of a deformed human."

His compositional style combined Romantic lyricism with the twelve-tone technique. Although he left a relatively small oeuvre he is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century for his expressive style encompassing \"entire worlds of emotion and structure\".Berg was born and lived in Vienna. He began to compose at the age of fifteen. He studied counterpoint music theory and harmony with Arnold Schoenberg between 1904 and 1911 and adopted his principles of developing variation and the twelve-tone technique. Berg's major works include the operas Wozzeck (1924) and Lulu (1935 finished posthumously) the chamber pieces Lyric Suite and Chamber Concerto as well as a Violin Concerto. He also composed a number of songs (lieder). He is said to have brought more \"human values\" to the twelve-tone system; his works are seen as more \"emotional\" than those of Schoenberg. His music had a surface glamour that won him admirers when Schoenberg himself had few.Berg died from sepsis in 1935."

        "article": "Karl Marx (German: [ma\u0281ks]; 5 May 1818 \u2013 14 March 1883) was a German-born philosopher economist political theorist historian sociologist journalist and revolutionary socialist. His best-known works are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (with Friedrich Engels) and the three-volume Das Kapital (1867\u20131894); the latter employs his critical approach of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism and is the culmination of his intellectual efforts. Marx's ideas and theories and their subsequent development collectively known as Marxism have exerted enormous influence on modern intellectual economic and political history.Born in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia Marx studied at the universities of Bonn Berlin and Jena and received a doctorate in philosophy from the latter in 1841. A Young Hegelian he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and both critiqued and developed Hegel's ideas in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857\u20131858). While in Paris in 1844 Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts and met Engels a lifelong friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845 they were active in the Communist League and in 1848 wrote The Communist Manifesto which expresses Marx's ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany and in 1849 moved to London where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. In 1864 Marx helped found the International Workingmen's Association (First International) in which he sought to fight the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875) Marx wrote on revolution the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.Marx's critiques of history society and political economy hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing his historical materialist approach Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx class antagonisms under capitalism\u2014owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature\u2014would eventuate the working class's development of class consciousness leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and his work has been both lauded and criticised. Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements and during the 20th century revolutionary governments identifying as Marxist took power in many countries and established socialist states including the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. A number of theoretical variants such as Leninism Marxism\u2013Leninism Trotskyism and Maoism have been developed. Marx's work in economics has a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and its relation to capital and he is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science."

        "article": "Myiasis ( my-EYE-\u0259-s\u0259ss) also known as flystrike or fly strike is the parasitic infestation of the body of a live animal by fly larvae (maggots) that grow inside the host while feeding on its tissue. Although flies are most commonly attracted to open wounds and urine- or feces-soaked fur some species (including the most common myiatic flies\u2014the botfly blowfly and screwfly) can create an infestation even on unbroken skin and have been known to use moist soil and non-myiatic flies (such as the common housefly) as vector agents for their parasitic larvae.Because some animals (particularly non-native domestic animals) cannot react as effectively as humans to the causes and effects of myiasis such infestations present a severe and continuing problem for livestock industries worldwide causing severe economic losses where they are not mitigated by human action. Although typically a far greater issue for animals myiasis is also a relatively frequent disease for humans in rural tropical regions where myiatic flies thrive and often may require medical attention to surgically remove the parasites.Myiasis varies widely in the forms it takes and its effects on those affected. Such variations depend largely on the fly species and where the larvae are located. Some flies lay eggs in open wounds other larvae may invade unbroken skin or enter the body through the nose or ears and still others may be swallowed if the eggs are deposited on the lips or on food. There can also be accidental myiasis that E. tenax can cause in humans via water containing the larvae or in contaminated uncooked food. The name of the condition derives from ancient Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u1fd6\u03b1 (myia) meaning \"fly\"."

For example some hypermobile people can bend their thumbs backwards to their wrists and bend their knee joints backwards put their leg behind the head or perform other contortionist \"tricks\". It can affect one or more joints throughout the body.Hypermobile joints are common and occur in about 10 to 25% of the population but in a minority of people pain and other symptoms are present. This may be a sign of hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). Hypermobile joints are a feature of genetic connective tissue disorders such as hypermobility spectrum disorder or Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes (EDS). Until new diagnostic criteria were introduced hypermobility syndrome was sometimes considered identical to hypermobile Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (hEDS) formerly called EDS Type 3. As no genetic test can distinguish the two conditions and because of the similarity of the diagnostic criteria and recommended treatments many experts recommend they be recognized as the same condition until further research is undertaken.In 2016 the diagnostic criteria for hEDS were re-written to be more restrictive with the intent of narrowing the pool of hEDS patients in the hope of making it easier to identify a common genetic mutation hEDS being the only EDS variant without a diagnostic DNA test. At the same time joint hypermobility syndrome was renamed as hypermobility spectrum disorder and redefined as a hypermobility disorder that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for hEDS other types of Ehlers\u2013Danlos Syndrome or other heritable Connective Tissue Disorder (such as Marfan's Loeys\u2013Dietz or osteogenesis imperfecta)."

A largely self-taught man in science he is commonly known as \"the Father of Microbiology\" and one of the first microscopists and microbiologists. Van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his pioneering work in microscopy and for his contributions toward the establishment of microbiology as a scientific discipline.Raised in Delft Dutch Republic Van Leeuwenhoek worked as a draper in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654. He became well-recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking. In the 1670s he started to explore microbial life with his microscope.Using single-lensed microscopes of his own design and make Van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and to experiment with microbes which he originally referred to as dierkens diertgens or diertjes. He was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the \"animalcules\" are now referred to as unicellular organisms although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document microscopic observations of muscle fibers bacteria spermatozoa red blood cells crystals in gouty tophi and among the first to see blood flow in capillaries. Although Van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books he described his discoveries in chaotic letters to the Royal Society which published many of his letters in their Philosophical Transactions."

Other symptoms may include redness warmth swelling and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types of arthritis other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden.There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers knees and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout lupus fibromyalgia and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease.Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Recommended medications may depend on the form of arthritis. These may include pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen). In some circumstances a joint replacement may be useful.Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1\u20132% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected by arthritis while in the United States more than 20% have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is derived from arthr- (meaning 'joint') and -itis (meaning 'inflammation')."

        "article": "Gout ( GOWT) is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red tender hot and swollen joint caused by the deposition of needle-like crystals of uric acid known as monosodium urate crystals. Pain typically comes on rapidly reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected (Podagra) in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi kidney stones or kidney damage.Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid (urate) in the blood (hyperuricemia). This occurs from a combination of diet other health problems and genetic factors. At high levels uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints tendons and surrounding tissues resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly drink beer or sugar-sweetened beverages; eat foods that are high in purines such as liver shellfish or anchovies; or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) glucocorticoids or colchicine improves symptoms. Once the acute attack subsides levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes and in those with frequent attacks allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and having a diet high in low-fat dairy products may be preventive.Gout affects about 1\u20132% of adults in the developed world at some point in their lives. It has become more common in recent decades. This is believed to be due to increasing risk factors in the population such as metabolic syndrome longer life expectancy and changes in diet. Older males are most commonly affected. Gout was historically known as \"the disease of kings\" or \"rich man's disease\". It has been recognized at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians."

        "article": "Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This deficiency occurs due to mutations in the HPRT1 gene located on the X chromosome. LNS affects about 1 in 380000 live births. The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by American medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor pediatrician William Nyhan at Johns Hopkins.The HGPRT deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. The combination of increased synthesis and decreased utilization of purines leads to high levels of uric acid production. This results in both high levels of uric acid in the blood and urine associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life a particularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing involuntary writhing and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington's disease. The cause of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGPRT causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12 some males may develop megaloblastic anemia.LNS is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner; the gene mutation is usually carried by the mother and passed on to her son although one-third of all cases arise de novo (from new mutations) and do not have a family history. LNS is present at birth in baby boys. Most but not all persons with this deficiency have severe mental and physical problems throughout life. Cases in females are very rare.The symptoms caused by the buildup of uric acid (gout and kidney symptoms) respond well to treatment with medications such as allopurinol that reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood. The mental deficits and self-mutilating behavior do not respond well to treatment. There is no cure but many affected people live to adulthood. Several new experimental treatments may alleviate symptoms."

Tophi are pathognomonic for the disease gout. Most people with tophi have had previous attacks of acute arthritis eventually leading to the formation of tophi. Chronic tophaceous gout is known as Harrison Syndrome. Tophi form in the joints cartilage bones and other places throughout the body. Sometimes tophi break through the skin and appear as white or yellowish-white chalky nodules. Without treatment tophi may develop on average about ten years after the onset of gout although their first appearance can range from three to forty-two years. The development of gouty tophi can also limit joint function and cause bone destruction leading to noticeable disabilities especially when gout cannot successfully be treated. When uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid (e.g. allopurinol febuxostat) or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys (e.g. probenecid) this can be referred to as refractory chronic gout (RCG).  They are more apt to appear early in the course of the disease in people who are older.Although less common tophi can also form in the kidneys and nasal cartilage."

IMF is a rare disorder with approximately 200 cases reported in the medical literature as of 2021. The World Health Organization in 2020 classified these nodules as a specific benign tumor type in the category of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors. IDF was first described by the Australian pathologist Douglas Reye in 1965.IDF consists of an overgrowth of spindle-shaped cells in a collagen fiber-rich background located in the dermis (i.e. the layer of skin between the  epidermis and subcutaneous tissue) but may extend into the subcutaneous tissue. These spindle-shaped cells contain distinctive inclusion bodies within their cytoplasm that greatly help in distinguishing IDF from other fibrous skin diseases. These inclusions are composed of densely packed vimentin and actin filaments.IDF lesions are usually painless and have a tendency to regress spontaneously. Consequently the current recommended treatment for IDF nodules is conservative observation. If the lesions cause local deformities and/or functional impairments or continue to increase in size over long observation periods surgical removal is recommended. However surgically removed IDF lesions have had high rates of recurrence and this surgery may cause post-operative digital deformities."

They can result in a range of symptoms from physical disfiguration and pain to cognitive disability.Neurofibromas arise from nonmyelinating-type Schwann cells that exhibit biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene that codes for the protein neurofibromin. This protein is responsible for regulating the RAS-mediated cell growth signaling pathway. In contrast to schwannomas another type of tumor arising from Schwann cells neurofibromas incorporate many additional types of cells and structural elements in addition to Schwann cells making it difficult to identify and understand all the mechanisms through which they originate and develop."

One of the roles of albumin is being the major driver of oncotic pressure (protein concentration within the blood) in the bloodstream and the body. Thus hypoalbuminemia leads to abnormal distributions of fluids within the body and its compartments. As a result associated symptoms include edema in the lower legs ascites in the abdomen and effusions around internal organs. Laboratory tests aimed at assessing liver function diagnose hypoalbuminemia. Once identified it is a poor prognostic indicator for patients with a variety of different diseases. Yet it is only treated in very specific indications in patients with cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome. Treatment instead focuses on the underlying cause of the hypoalbuminemia.

Sections are customarily surveyed into smaller squares by repeated halving and quartering. A quarter section is 160 acres (65\u00a0ha) and a \"quarter-quarter section\" is 40 acres (16\u00a0ha). In 1832 the smallest area of land that could be acquired was reduced to the 40-acre (16\u00a0ha) quarter-quarter section and this size parcel became entrenched in American mythology. After the Civil War freedmen (freed slaves) were reckoned to be self-sufficient with \"40 acres and a mule.\" In the 20th century real estate developers preferred working with 40-acre (16\u00a0ha) parcels. The phrases \"front 40\" and \"back 40\" referring to farm fields indicate the front and back quarter-quarter sections of land.One of the reasons for creating sections of 640 acres (260\u00a0ha) was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres. A section can be halved seven times in this way down to a 5-acre (2\u00a0ha) parcel or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section\u2014an easily surveyed 50-square-chain (2\u00a0ha) area. This system was of great practical value on the American frontier where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly.A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form might look like \"NW 1/4 NE 1/4 Sec. 34 T.3S R.1W 1st P.M.\" or alternatively \"34-3-1 NW4NE4 1PM\". In expanded form this would read \"the Northwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 34 of Township 3 South Range 1 West first Principal Meridian\"."

Alternative names have been suggested for this class such as special-subject or special-purpose maps statistical maps or distribution maps but these have generally fallen out of common usage. Thematic mapping is closely allied with the field of Geovisualization.Several types of thematic maps have been invented starting in the 18th and 19th centuries as large amounts of statistical data began to be collected and published such as national censuses. These types such as choropleth maps isarithmic maps and chorochromatic maps use very different strategies for representing the location and attributes of geographic phenomena such that each is preferable for different forms of phenomena and different forms of available data. A wide variety of phenomena and data can thus be visualized using thematic maps including those from the natural world (e.g. climate soils) and the human world (e.g. demographics public health)"

Most instances of fatal drowning occur alone or in situations where others present are either unaware of the victim's situation or unable to offer assistance. After successful resuscitation drowning victims may experience breathing problems vomiting confusion or unconsciousness. Occasionally victims may not begin experiencing these symptoms until several hours after they are rescued. An incident of drowning can also cause further complications for victims due to low body temperature aspiration of vomit or acute respiratory distress syndrome (respiratory failure from lung inflammation).Drowning is more likely to happen when spending extended periods of time near large bodies of water. Risk factors for drowning include alcohol use drug use epilepsy minimal swim training or a complete lack of training and in the case of children a lack of supervision. Common drowning locations include natural and man-made bodies of water bathtubs and swimming pools.Drowning occurs when a person spends too much time with their nose and mouth submerged in a liquid to the point of being unable to breathe. If this is not followed by an exit to the surface low oxygen levels and excess carbon dioxide in the blood trigger a neurological state of breathing emergency which results in increased physical distress and occasional contractions of the vocal folds. Significant amounts of water usually only enter the lungs later in the process.While the word \"drowning\" is commonly associated with fatal results drowning may be classified into three different types: drowning that results in death drowning that results in long-lasting health problems and drowning that results in no health complications. Sometimes the term \"near-drowning\" is used in the latter cases. Among children who survive health problems occur in about 7.5% of cases.Steps to prevent drowning include teaching children and adults to swim and to recognise unsafe water conditions never swimming alone use of personal flotation devices on boats and when swimming in unfavourable conditions limiting or removing access to water (such as with fencing of swimming pools) and exercising appropriate supervision. Treatment of victims who are not breathing should begin with opening the airway and providing five breaths of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is recommended for a person whose heart has stopped beating and has been underwater for less than an hour."

However further testing may be needed if red flags are present like hearing loss dizziness ringing in the ear or unexpected weight loss.Management of ear pain depends on the cause. If there is a bacterial infection antibiotics are sometimes recommended and over the counter pain medications can help control discomfort.

At the site of the bite there is typically a red skin sore with a dark center. The onset of symptoms usually occurs 4\u201310 days after the bite. Complications are rare but may include joint inflammation. Some people do not develop symptoms.Tick bite fever is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia africae. The bacterium is spread by ticks of the Amblyomma type. These generally live in tall grass or bush rather than in cities. The diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. It can be confirmed by culture PCR or immunofluorescence.There is no vaccine. Prevention is by avoiding tick bites by covering the skin using DEET or using permethrin treated clothing. Evidence regarding treatment however is limited. The antibiotic doxycycline appears useful. Chloramphenicol or azithromycin may also be used. The disease will also tend to resolve without treatment.The disease occurs in sub-Saharan Africa the West Indies and Oceania. It is relatively common among travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. Most infections occur between November and April. Outbreaks of the disease may occur. The earliest descriptions of the condition are believed to be from 1911. African tick bite fever is a type of spotted fever. It has previously been confused with Mediterranean spotted fever."

It is a member of the phylum Arthropoda class Arachnida. The adult lone star tick is sexually dimorphic named for a silvery-white star-shaped spot or \"lone star\" present near the center of the posterior portion of the adult female shield (scutum); adult males conversely have varied white streaks or spots around the margins of their shields.A. americanum is also referred to as the turkey tick in some Midwestern U.S. states where wild turkeys are a common host for immature ticks. It is the primary vector of Ehrlichia chaffeensis which causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis and Ehrlichia ewingii which causes human and canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis. It may also cause a person to develop alpha-gal syndrome an allergy to non-catarrhine mammalian meat. Other disease-causing bacterial agents isolated from lone star ticks include Francisella tularensis Rickettsia amblyommii and Coxiella burnetti."

Adult ticks are approximately 3 to 5\u00a0mm in length depending on age sex species and \"fullness\". Ticks are external parasites living by feeding on the blood of mammals birds and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. The timing of the origin of ticks is uncertain though the oldest known tick fossils are from the Cretaceous period around 100 million years old. Ticks are widely distributed around the world especially in warm humid climates.Ticks belong to two major families the Ixodidae or hard ticks and the Argasidae or soft ticks. Nuttalliella a genus of tick from southern Africa is the only member of the family Nuttalliellidae and represents the most primitive living lineage of ticks. Adults have ovoid/pear-shaped bodies (idiosomas) which become engorged with blood when they feed and eight legs. Their cephalothorax and abdomen are completely fused. In addition to having a hard shield on their dorsal surfaces known as the scutum hard ticks have a beak-like structure at the front containing the mouthparts whereas soft ticks have their mouthparts on the underside of their bodies. Ticks locate potential hosts by sensing odor body heat moisture and/or vibrations in the environment.Ticks have four stages to their life cycle namely egg larva nymph and adult. Ticks belonging to the Ixodidae family undergo either a one-host two-host or three-host life cycle. Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars) each one requiring blood ingestion and as such Argasid ticks undergo a multihost life cycle. Because of their hematophagous (blood-ingesting) diets ticks act as vectors of many serious diseases that affect humans and other animals."

Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath chest pain particularly upon breathing in and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present such as a red warm swollen and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels rapid breathing rapid heart rate and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out abnormally low blood pressure obstructive shock and sudden death.PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung. The risk of blood clots is increased by advanced age cancer prolonged bed rest and immobilization smoking stroke long-haul travel over 4 hours certain genetic conditions estrogen-based medication pregnancy obesity trauma or bone fracture and after some types of surgery. A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air fat or amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results. If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer may rule out the condition. Otherwise a CT pulmonary angiography lung ventilation/perfusion scan or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis. Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery lower leg exercises during periods of sitting and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery. Treatment is with anticoagulants such as heparin warfarin or one of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). These are recommended for at least three months. However treatment using anticoagulants is not recommended for those at high risk of bleeding as well as those with renal failure. Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) given intravenously or through a catheter and some may require surgery (a pulmonary thrombectomy). If blood thinners are not appropriate a temporary vena cava filter may be used.Pulmonary emboli affect about 430000 people each year in Europe. In the United States between 300000 and 600000 cases occur each year which contribute to at least 40000 deaths. Rates are similar in males and females. They become more common as people get older."

SVT itself has limited significance (in terms of direct morbidity and mortality) when compared to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which occurs deeper in the body at the deep venous system level. However SVT can lead to serious complications (as well as signal other serious problems such as genetic mutations that increase one's risk for clotting) and is therefore no longer regarded as a benign condition. If the blood clot is too near the saphenofemoral junction there is a higher risk of pulmonary embolism a potentially life-threatening complication.SVT has risk factors similar to those for other thrombotic conditions and can arise from a variety of causes. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms. There are multiple possible treatments with the goal of providing symptomatic relief and preventing complications."

A second autopsy requested by her family revealed further abrasions to her body. The family's attorney also stated that lack of evidence types of injuries discovered and mismatched witness accounts strongly suggested homicide. On February 20 2019 Major Joe Perkins of the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office announced that the case would be closed and that there was no evidence of foul play. The relationship between Horsford's race and her death has been a subject of controversy and debate and a race-based dimension to her death has been implied by family and media. While the official investigation concluded that her death was accidental and not racially motivated some have argued that her race played a role in the events leading up to her death and in the investigation that followed.The case did not receive public recognition until two months after her death when one of the witnesses was fired from his county court officer job for internally accessing the incident report. The case along with the hashtag #tamlahorsford quickly spread around the internet along with suspicion of foul play. In the summer of 2020 the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the murder of George Floyd renewed public interest and advocacy of the case. Under the pressure of public outcry including posts from celebrities such as T.I. and 50 Cent the Forsyth County Sheriff requested that the case be reopened and investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation."

Gloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat damage by friction abrasion or chemicals and disease; or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch.Gloves are made of materials including cloth knitted or felted wool leather rubber latex neoprene silk and (in mail) metal. Gloves of kevlar protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of pressure suits and spacesuits.Latex nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints.If there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves are useful where dexterity is required that gloves would restrict. Cigarette smokers and church organists sometimes use fingerless gloves. Cycling gloves for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. Guitar players may also use fingerless gloves in circumstances where it is too cold to play with an uncovered hand.A hybrid of glove and mitten contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers (as in a fingerless glove but not the thumb) and an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers. This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by Velcro or a button) to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. These hybrids are called convertible mittens or \"glittens\"."

        "article": "Metallosis is the medical condition involving deposition and build-up of metal debris in the soft tissues of the body.Metallosis has been known to occur when metallic components in medical implants specifically joint replacements abrade against one another. Metallosis has also been observed in some patients either sensitive to the implant or for unknown reasons even in the absence of malpositioned prosthesis. Though rare metallosis has been observed at an estimated incidence of 5% of metal joint implant patients over the last 40 years. Women may be at slightly higher risk than men. If metallosis occurs it may involve the hip and knee joints the shoulder  wrist elbow joints or spine. In the spine the wear debris and resulting inflammatory reaction may result in a mass often referred to as a \"metalloma\" in medical literature which may lead to neurological impairment over time. A similar condition has been also described when titanium dental implant degradation occurs leading to inflammatory titanium particle-mediated Peri-implantitis. Titanium particles in the peri-implant tissues do not occur via functional abrasion but are thought to result from damaging hygiene procedures or due to complex electrochemical interactions caused by oral bacteria.The abrasion of metal components may cause metal ions to be solubilized. The hypothesis that the immune system identifies the metal ions as foreign bodies and inflames the area around the debris may be incorrect because of the small size of metal ions may prevent them from becoming haptens.  Poisoning from metallosis is rare but cobaltism is an established health concern.  The involvement of the immune system in this putative condition has also been theorized but has never been proven.Purported symptoms of metallosis generally include pain around the site of the implant pseudotumors (a mass of inflamed cells that resembles a tumor but is actually collected fluids) and a noticeable rash that indicates necrosis.  The damaged and inflamed tissue can also contribute to loosening the implant or medical device. Metallosis can cause dislocation of non-cemented implants as the healthy tissue that would normally hold the implant in place is weakened or destroyed. Metallosis has been demonstrated to cause osteolysis.Women those who are small in stature and the obese are at greater risk for metallosis because their body structure causes more tension on the implant quickening the abrasion of the metal components and the subsequent build-up of metallic debris."

        "article": "Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation in a short period of time. Symptoms can start within an hour of exposure and can last for several months. Early symptoms are usually nausea vomiting and loss of appetite. In the following hours or weeks initial symptoms may appear to improve before the development of additional symptoms after which either recovery or death follow.ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad) that generally occurs from a source outside the body delivered within a few minutes. Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally. They may involve nuclear reactors cyclotrons certain devices used in cancer therapy nuclear weapons or radiological weapons. It is generally divided into three types: bone marrow gastrointestinal and neurovascular syndrome with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10\u00a0Gy and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50\u00a0Gy. The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing. At high doses this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable. Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms. Repeated complete blood counts (CBCs) can indicate the severity of exposure.Treatment of ARS is generally supportive care. This may include blood transfusions antibiotics colony-stimulating factors or stem cell transplant. Radioactive material remaining on the skin or in the stomach should be removed. If radioiodine was inhaled or ingested potassium iodide is recommended. Complications such as leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual. Short term outcomes depend on the dose exposure.ARS is generally rare. A single event can affect a large number of people as happened in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. ARS differs from chronic radiation syndrome which occurs following prolonged exposures to relatively low doses of radiation."

        "article": "Pathogenic bacteria are bacteria that can cause disease. This article focuses on the bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. Most species of bacteria are harmless and are often beneficial but others can cause infectious diseases. The number of these pathogenic species in humans is estimated to be fewer than a hundred. By contrast several thousand species are part of the gut flora present in the digestive tract.The body is continually exposed to many species of bacteria including beneficial commensals which grow on the skin and mucous membranes and saprophytes which grow mainly in the soil and in decaying matter. The blood and tissue fluids contain nutrients sufficient to sustain the growth of many bacteria. The body has  defence mechanisms that enable it  to resist microbial invasion of its tissues and give it a natural immunity or innate resistance against many microorganisms.Pathogenic bacteria are specially adapted and endowed with mechanisms for overcoming the normal body defences and can invade parts of the body such as the blood where bacteria are not normally found. Some pathogens invade only the surface epithelium skin or mucous membrane but many travel more deeply spreading through the tissues and disseminating by the lymphatic and blood streams. In some rare cases a pathogenic microbe can infect an entirely healthy person but infection usually occurs only if the body's defence mechanisms are damaged by some local trauma or an underlying debilitating disease such as wounding intoxication chilling fatigue and malnutrition. In many cases it is important to differentiate infection and colonization which is when the bacteria are causing little or no harm.Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria one of the diseases with the highest disease burden is tuberculosis which killed 1.4 million people in 2019 mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases such as pneumonia which can be caused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus  Streptococcus and Pseudomonas and foodborne illnesses which can be caused by bacteria such as Shigella Campylobacter and Salmonella. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus typhoid fever diphtheria syphilis and leprosy.Pathogenic bacteria are also the cause of high infant mortality rates in developing countries. A GBD study estimated the global death rates from (33) bacterial pathogens finding such infections contributed to one in 8 deaths (or ~7.7 million deaths) which could make it the second largest cause of death globally in 2019.Most pathogenic bacteria can be grown in cultures and identified by Gram stain and other methods. Bacteria grown in this way are often tested to find which antibiotics will be an effective treatment for the infection. For hitherto unknown pathogens Koch's postulates are the standard to establish a causative relationship between a microbe and a disease."

Most penicillins in clinical use are synthesised by P. chrysogenum using deep tank fermentation and then purified. A number of natural penicillins have been discovered but only two purified compounds are in clinical use: penicillin G (intramuscular or intravenous use) and penicillin V (given by mouth). Penicillins were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today for different bacterial infections though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.Ten percent of the population claims penicillin allergies but because the frequency of positive skin test results decreases by 10% with each year of avoidance 90% of these patients can eventually tolerate penicillin. Additionally those with penicillin allergies can usually tolerate cephalosporins (another group of \u03b2-lactam) because the immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactivity is only 3%.Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming as a crude extract of P. rubens. Fleming's student Cecil George Paine was the first to successfully use penicillin to treat eye infection (neonatal conjunctivitis) in 1930. The purified compound (penicillin F) was isolated in 1940 by a research team led by Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the University of Oxford. Fleming first used the purified penicillin to treat streptococcal meningitis in 1942. The 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared by Chain Fleming and Florey.Several semisynthetic penicillins are effective against a broader spectrum of bacteria: these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins aminopenicillins and antipseudomonal penicillins."

This condition is also called rapid gastric emptying. It is mostly associated with conditions following gastric or esophageal surgery though it can also arise secondary to diabetes or to the use of certain medications; it is caused by an absent or insufficiently functioning pyloric sphincter the valve between the stomach and the duodenum.Dumping syndrome has two forms based on when symptoms occur. Early dumping syndrome occurs 10 to 30 minutes after a meal. It results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach. The small intestine expands rapidly due to the presence of hypertonic/hyperosmolar contents from the stomach especially sweet foods. This causes symptoms due to the shift of fluid into the intestinal lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. Osmotic diarrhea distension of the small bowel leading to crampy abdominal pain and reduced blood volume can result.Late dumping syndrome occurs 2 to 3 hours after a meal. It results from excessive movement of sugar into the intestine which raises the body's blood glucose level and causes the pancreas to increase its release of the hormone insulin. The increased release of insulin causes a rapid drop in blood glucose levels a condition known as alimentary hypoglycemia or low blood sugar."

        "article": "A burn is an injury to skin or other tissues caused by heat cold electricity chemicals friction or ultraviolet radiation (such as sunburn). Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding) solids or fire. Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace. In the home risks are associated with domestic kitchens including stoves flames and hot liquids. In the workplace risks are associated with fire and chemical and electric burns. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault).Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues such as muscle tendons or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.In 2015 fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries. This resulted in about 2.9 million hospitalizations and 176000 deaths. Among women in much of the world burns are most commonly related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men they are more likely a result of unsafe workplace conditions. Most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world particularly in Southeast Asia. While large burns can be fatal treatments developed since 1960 have improved outcomes especially in children and young adults. In the United States approximately 96% of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries. The long-term outcome is related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected."

Approximately 1000 deaths per year due to electrical injuries are reported in the United States with a mortality rate of 3-5%. Electrical burns differ from thermal or chemical burns in that they cause much more subdermal damage. They can exclusively cause surface damage but more often tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged. As a result electrical burns are difficult to accurately diagnose and many people underestimate the severity of their burn. In extreme cases electricity can cause shock to the brain strain to the heart and injury to other organs.For a burn to be classified as electrical electricity must be the direct cause. For example burning a finger on a hot electric steam iron would be thermal not electrical. According to Joule's first law: electricity passing through resistance creates heat so there is no current entering the body in this type of burn. Likewise a fire that is ruled to be \"electrical\" in origin does not necessarily  mean that any injuries or deaths are due to electrical burns. Unless someone was injured at the exact moment that the fire began it is unlikely that any electrical burns would occur."

This is often uncomfortable and even painful but rarely results in bleeding.A person's own skin (or the skin of another person) may be sufficient to act as an abrasive surface to cause friction burn. More commonly friction with abrasive surfaces including clothing carpet or rope can lead to a friction burn. Common places at which skin-to-skin chafing can occur are between the thighs and under the armpits.

This group is distributed worldwide with about 2000 described species.They are called lace bugs because the pronotum and fore wings of the adult have a delicate and intricate network of divided areas that resemble lace. Their body appearance is flattened dorsoventrally and they can be broadly oval or slender. Often the head is concealed under the hood-like pronotum.Lace bugs are usually host-specific and can be very destructive to plants. Most feed on the undersides of leaves by piercing the epidermis and sucking the sap. The then empty cells give the leaves a bronzed or silvery appearance. Each individual usually completes its entire lifecycle on the same plant if not the same part of the plant.Most species have one to two generations per year but some species have multiple generations. Most overwinter as adults but some species overwinter as eggs or nymphs. This group has incomplete metamorphosis in that the immature stages resemble the adults except that the immatures are smaller and do not have wings. However wing pads appear in the second and third instars and increase in size as the nymph matures. Depending on the species lace bugs have four  or five instars.Lace bugs sometimes fall out of trees land on people and bite which although painful is a minor nuisance. No medical treatment is necessary.  There are reports in Europe e.g. Italy France and Romania of Corythucha ciliata biting humans and some people have painful reactions e.g. dermatosis."

It is facultatively anaerobic coagulase-variable and can be readily cultured on blood agar where the bacterium tends to form opaque non-pigmented colonies and beta (\u03b2) hemolysis. There exists two subspecies under the species S. schleiferi: Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. schleiferi (coagulase negative) and Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans (coagulase positive).Staphylococcus schleiferi is commonly recognized as a veterinary pathogen affecting household pets but has not been identified as a disease causing organism in large animals. S. schleiferi has been identified as a causative agent of conditions of Pyoderma Otitis Externa and Otitis media in both dogs and cats; although more commonly causing inflammatory conditions in dogs than in cats. Human infections have been described in some case reports resulting in certain disease conditions including: surgical site infections pediatric meningitis endocarditis and intravascular device-related bacteremia. Although both companion animals and humans can acquire disease from this organism its zoonotic potential is not well understood. Antimicrobial therapy has been generally successful in treatment of infections however resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics have been reported resulting in persistent infections for both humans and veterinary species.Since its first description in 1988 little has been reported regarding the pathogenicity and virulence of Staphylococcus schleiferi. However similarities with infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus suggest that the two species may also share similar determinants of virulence. Virulence factors associated with S. schleiferi have been identified to include the production of fatty acid modifying enzyme (FAME) biofilms penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) as well as various enterotoxins and exoenzymes.Staphylococcus schleiferi is differentiated from other Staphylococcal species based on their coagulation reaction but because there is a coagulase positive and a coagulase negative subspecies of S. schleiferi additional biochemical tests are required. These tests are often not done clinically as treatment is based on susceptibility testing and location of the infection."

It is generally spread through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia and occurs most frequently in the tropics and sub-tropics of Africa Asia the Americas and southern Europe. The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous  mucocutaneous or visceral. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin mouth and nose. The visceral form starts with skin ulcers and later presents with fever low red blood cell count and enlarged spleen and liver.Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania. Risk factors include poverty malnutrition deforestation and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under microscopy. Additionally visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests.Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired the species of Leishmania and the type of infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease paromomycin fluconazole or pentamidine may be effective.About 4 to 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200\u00a0million people in Asia Africa South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has obtained discounts on some medications to treat the disease. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. The disease may occur in a number of other animals including dogs and rodents."

In the United States sandfly may refer to certain horse flies that are also known as \"greenheads\" (family Tabanidae) or to members of the family Ceratopogonidae. The bites usually result in a small intensely itchy bump or welt the strength of which intensifies over a period of 5-7 days before dissipating.  Moderate relief is achieved with varying success through the application of over the counter products such as Benadryl (ingested) or an analgesic cream such as After Bite (applied topically).  Outside the United States sandfly may refer to members of the subfamily Phlebotominae within the Psychodidae. Biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) are sometimes called sandflies or no-see-ums (no-see-em noseeum). New Zealand sandflies are in the genus of sand fly  Austrosimulium a type of black fly.In the various sorts of sandfly only the female is responsible for biting and sucking the blood of mammals reptiles and birds; the protein in the blood is necessary for the production of eggs making the sandfly an anautogenous reproducer.Some sandfly genera of the subfamily Phlebotominae are the primary vectors of leishmaniasis and pappataci fever; both diseases are confusingly referred to as sandfly fever. In Asia Africa and Europe leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus; in the Americas the disease is spread by sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia. Belize and Honduras are notorious in the Caribbean for their sandfly populations and travel pages frequently warn tourists to bring bug spray containing high concentrations of DEET."

Damage to nerves may impair sensation movement gland function and/or organ function depending on which nerve fibers are affected. Neuropathies affecting motor sensory or autonomic nerve fibers result in different symptoms. More than one type of fiber may be affected simultaneously. Peripheral neuropathy may be acute (with sudden onset rapid progress) or chronic (symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly) and may be reversible or permanent.Common causes include systemic diseases (such as diabetes or leprosy) hyperglycemia-induced glycation vitamin deficiency medication (e.g. chemotherapy or commonly prescribed antibiotics including metronidazole and the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin levofloxacin moxifloxacin)) traumatic injury ischemia radiation therapy excessive alcohol consumption immune system disease celiac disease non-celiac gluten sensitivity or viral infection. It can also be genetic (present from birth) or idiopathic (no known cause). In conventional medical usage the word neuropathy (neuro- \"nervous system\" and -pathy \"disease of\") without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy.Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called \"mononeuropathy\" and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called \"symmetrical polyneuropathy\" or simply \"polyneuropathy\". When two or more (typically just a few but sometimes many) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called \"mononeuritis multiplex\" \"multifocal mononeuropathy\" or \"multiple mononeuropathy\".Neuropathy may cause painful cramps fasciculations (fine muscle twitching) muscle loss bone degeneration and changes in the skin hair and nails. Additionally motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance and coordination or most commonly muscle weakness; sensory neuropathy may cause numbness to touch and vibration reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain spontaneous tingling or burning pain or allodynia (pain from normally nonpainful stimuli such as light touch); and autonomic neuropathy may produce diverse symptoms depending on the affected glands and organs but common symptoms are poor bladder control abnormal blood pressure or heart rate and reduced ability to sweat normally."

Alopecia is a condition that can affect wild organisms and captive organisms however the condition tends to be more prominent in captive contexts. Development of alopecia in animals is usually the sign of an underlying disease.  Some animals may be genetically predisposed to hair loss while in some it may be caused by hypersensitivity or nutritional factors. These include Moluccan cockatoos spectacled bears hedgehogs raccoons squirrels baboons and chimpanzees since they share 98% of human genes. Others that are selectively bred to have baldness include rabbits guinea pigs Syrian hamsters mice rats and cats. Environmental enrichment has been used in some cases to mitigate certain behaviours that cause hair loss improve alopecia and address welfare concerns.Canine pinnal alopecia is most common in dachshunds but others such as Chihuahuas Boston terriers whippets and Italian greyhounds may also be vulnerable. Certain skin conditions in animals can also cause loss of fur. Ferret adrenal disease is extremely common and is the most common cause of alopecia in ferrets typically affecting middle-aged specimens between three and seven years old. Bacterial pyoderma dermatophytosis and parasites can also cause the condition.  In rabbits dermatophytosis is a prime cause of alopecia in young newly weaned specimens. Dermatophytosis as a cause of alopecia is common in cats too and in long-haired varieties dermatophytic pseudomycetomas may be to blame. Alopecia areata has been studied on mice in laboratories. In horses human contact with the horse and the rubbing of the saddle across the mane can cause patches of hair loss."

It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows and ahead of all Linux distributions including ChromeOS.Mac OS X succeeded classic Mac OS the primary Macintosh operating system from 1984 to 2001. Its underlying architecture came from NeXT's NeXTSTEP as a result of Apple's acquisition of NeXT which also brought Steve Jobs back to Apple.The first desktop version Mac OS X 10.0 was released on March 24 2001. All releases from Mac OS X Leopard onward (except for OS X Lion) are UNIX 03 certified. The derivatives of macOS are Apple's other operating systems: iOS iPadOS watchOS tvOS and audioOS.A prominent part of macOS's original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X pronounced \"ten\" as well as code naming each release after species of big cats and later places within California. Apple shortened the name to \"OS X\" in 2011 and then changed it to \"macOS\" in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems iOS watchOS and tvOS. After sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10 macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020 and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number similarly to classic Mac OS and iOS.macOS has supported three major processor architectures beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006 Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020 Apple began the Apple silicon transition using self-designed 64-bit Arm-based Apple M series processors on the latest Macintosh computers. As of 2023 the most recent release of macOS is macOS 14 Sonoma."

        "article": "The history of macOS Apple's current Mac operating system formerly named Mac OS X until 2011 and then OS X until 2016 began with the company's project to replace its \"classic\" Mac OS. That system up to and including its final release Mac OS 9 was a direct descendant of the operating system Apple had used in its Mac computers since their introduction in 1984. However the current macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT from the 1980s until Apple purchased the company in early 1997.Although it was originally marketed as simply \"version 10\" of Mac OS (indicated by the Roman numeral \"X\") it has a completely different codebase from Mac OS 9 as well as substantial changes to its user interface. The transition was a technologically and strategically significant one. To ease the transition for users and developers versions 10.0 through 10.4 were able to run Mac OS 9 and its applications in the Classic Environment a compatibility layer.macOS was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0. It was built using the technologies Apple acquired from NeXT but did not include the signature Aqua user interface (UI). The desktop version aimed at regular users\u2014Mac OS X 10.0\u2014shipped in March 2001. Since then several more distinct desktop and server editions of macOS have been released. Starting with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion macOS Server is no longer offered as a standalone operating system; instead server management tools are available for purchase as an add-on. The macOS Server app was discontinued on April 21 2022 and will stop working on macOS 13 Ventura or later. Starting with the Intel build of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard most releases have been certified as Unix systems conforming to the Single UNIX Specification.Lion was referred to by Apple as \"Mac OS X Lion\" and sometimes as \"OS X Lion\"; Mountain Lion was officially referred to as just \"OS X Mountain Lion\" with the \"Mac\" being completely dropped. The operating system was further renamed to \"macOS\" starting with macOS Sierra.From the introduction of machines not supporting the classic Mac OS in 2003 until the introduction of iPhone OS in early 2007 Mac OS X was Apple's only software platform.macOS retained the major version number 10 throughout its development history until the release of macOS 11 Big Sur in 2020.Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 were given names of big cats as internal code names (\"Cheetah\" and \"Puma\").  Starting with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar big-cat names were used as marketing names; starting with OS X 10.9 Mavericks names of locations in California were used as marketing names instead.The current major version macOS 14 Sonoma was announced on June 5 2023 at WWDC 2023 and released on September 26 of that year."

The system rebranded \"Mac OS\" in 1997 was pre-installed on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. It was noted for its ease of use and also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors.The current Mac operating system is macOS originally named \"Mac OS X\" until 2012 and then \"OS X\" until 2016. It was developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT. It brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP a Unix system that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced such as problems with memory management. The current macOS is pre-installed with every Mac and receives a major update annually. It is the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices\u00a0\u2013 iOS iPadOS watchOS and tvOS.Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X Apple experimented with several other concepts releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa A/UX MAE and MkLinux. Apple's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects code named Star Trek Taligent and Copland.Although the classic Mac OS and macOS (Mac OS X) have different architectures they share a common set of GUI principles including a menu bar across the top of the screen; the Finder shell featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can; and overlapping windows for multitasking.Before the arrival of the Macintosh in 1984 Apple's history of operating systems began with its Apple II series computers in 1977 which ran Apple DOS ProDOS and later GS/OS; the Apple III in 1980 which ran Apple SOS; and the Apple Lisa in 1983 which ran Lisa OS and later MacWorks XL a Macintosh emulator. Apple also developed the Newton OS for its Newton personal digital assistant from 1993 to 1997.In recent years Apple has also launched several new operating systems based on the core of macOS including iOS in 2007 for its iPhone iPad and iPod Touch mobile devices and in 2017 for its HomePod smart speakers; watchOS in 2015 for the Apple Watch; tvOS in 2015 for the Apple TV set-top box."

        "article": "OS/2 (Operating System/2) is a series of computer operating systems initially created by Microsoft and IBM under the leadership of IBM software designer Ed Iacobucci. As a result of a feud between the two companies over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft's new Windows 3.1 operating environment the two companies severed the relationship in 1992 and OS/2 development fell to IBM exclusively. The name stands for \"Operating System/2\" because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's \"Personal System/2 (PS/2)\" line of second-generation personal computers. The first version of OS/2 was initially released in December 1987 and newer versions were released until December 2001.OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC\u00a0DOS targeting the Intel 80286 processor. Notably basic system calls were modeled after MS-DOS calls; their names even started with \"Dos\" and it was possible to create \"Family Mode\" applications \u2013 text mode applications that could work on both systems. Because of this heritage OS/2 shares similarities with Unix Xenix and Windows NT.Up to $990 million per year was spent developing OS/2 and its replacement. OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals; however by the early 1990s it was overtaken by Microsoft Windows NT. While OS/2 was arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95 OS/2 failed to develop much penetration in the mass market consumer and stand-alone desktop PC segments.IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on December 31 2006. Since then OS/2 has been developed supported and sold by two different third-party vendors under license from IBM \u2013 first by Serenity Systems as eComStation since 2001 and later by Arca Noae LLC as ArcaOS since 2017."

Along with inhalation ingestion and injection dermal absorption is a route of exposure for toxic substances and route of administration for medication. Absorption of substances through the skin depends on a number of factors the most important of which are concentration duration of contact solubility of medication and physical condition of the skin and part of the body exposed.Skin (percutaneous dermal) absorption is the transport of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into the skin and into circulation. Skin absorption relates to the degree of exposure to and possible effect of a substance which may enter the body through the skin. Human skin comes into contact with many agents intentionally and unintentionally. Skin absorption can occur from occupational environmental or consumer skin exposure to chemicals cosmetics or pharmaceutical products. Some chemicals can be absorbed in enough quantity to cause detrimental systemic effects. Skin disease (dermatitis) is considered one of the most common occupational diseases. In order to assess if a chemical can be a risk of either causing dermatitis or other more systemic effects and how that risk may be reduced one must know the extent to which it is absorbed. Thus dermal exposure is a key aspect of human health risk assessment."

About 50% of snakebite cases can be dry bites. They are characterized by fang and tooth marks and the absence of injected venom.The first clinically observed dry snake bite occurred in London in 1892 from a South American rattlesnake.

        "article": "The inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) also commonly known as the western taipan small-scaled snake or fierce snake is a species of extremely venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species is endemic to semiarid regions of central east Australia. Aboriginal Australians living in those regions named the snake dandarabilla. It was formally described by Frederick McCoy in 1879 and then by William John Macleay in 1882 but for the next 90 years it was a mystery to the scientific community; no further specimens were found and virtually nothing was added to the knowledge of this species until its rediscovery in 1972.Based on the median lethal dose value in mice the venom of the inland taipan is by far the most toxic of any snake \u2013 much more so than even that of sea snakes \u2013 and it has the most toxic venom of any reptile when tested on human heart cell culture. The inland taipan is a specialist hunter of mammals so its venom is specially adapted to kill warm-blooded species. One bite possesses enough lethality to kill more than an estimated 100 fully grown humans. It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy  often striking multiple times in the same attack and it envenomates in almost every case.Although the most venomous and a capable striker in contrast to the coastal taipan which many experts cite as an extremely dangerous snake due to its behaviour when it encounters humans the inland taipan is usually quite a shy and reclusive snake with a placid disposition and prefers to escape from trouble. However it will defend itself and strike if provoked mishandled or prevented from escaping. Because it lives in such remote locations the inland taipan seldom comes in contact with people; therefore it is not considered the deadliest snake in the world overall especially in terms of disposition and human deaths per year. The word \"fierce\" from its alternative name describes its venom not its temperament."

        "article": "Below is a list of fatal snakebites that occurred in Australia.  Omitted incidents include cases where someone died from falling after receiving a bite. Some of the comments include the first aid or treatment that was attempted. For the older fatalities the term ligature meant wrapping a limb or finger with a string to act like a tourniquet and the term scarify meant cutting the skin so blood flows out of the body presumably to flush venom. Current practice advises not washing the affected body part so that medical personnel can sample venom residue on the skin to determine which type of snake was involved.Although Australian snakes can be very venomous comparatively little is known about the protein compositions of venoms from Australian snakes compared to those of Asia and America. Wide access to antivenom and adequate medical care has made deaths exceedingly rare with only a few fatalities each year.  Australian snakes possess potent venom: 5 of the world's top 10 most venomous snakes live in Australia.The estimated incidence of snakebites annually in Australia is between 3 and 18 per 100000 with an average mortality rate of 0.03 per 100000 per year or roughly 1 to 2 persons down from 13 persons per year in the 1920s. Between 1979 and 1998 there were 53 deaths from snakes according to data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Between 1942 and 1950 there were 56 deaths from snakebite recorded in Australia. Of 28 deaths in the 1945-1949 period 18 occurred in Queensland 6 in New South Wales 3 in Western Australia and 1 in Tasmania. Globally 1.8\u20132.7 million people are envenomed annually with more than 125000 people dying and for every fatality there are another 3 to 4 people permanently disabled. In 2017 the World Health Organization added snakebite envenoming to their list of Neglected tropical diseases requesting the cooperation of antivenom agencies worldwide.A Queensland Government occupational health publication says that \"Snakes are not usually aggressive and do not seek confrontation with humans but may retaliate if provoked. The important thing to remember is to never attempt to catch or kill a snake \u2013 most snake bites occur when people are trying to do this.\""

        "article": "Snakes are elongated limbless carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes (). Like all other squamates snakes are ectothermic amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have independently evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent evolution leading to many lineages of legless lizards. These resemble snakes but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears which snakes lack although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia Dibamidae and Pygopodidae).Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands such as Ireland Iceland Greenland and the islands of New Zealand as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans. Additionally sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans. Around thirty families are currently recognized comprising about 520 genera and about 3900 species. They range in size from the tiny 10.4\u00a0cm-long (4.1\u00a0in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8\u00a0ft) in length. The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42\u00a0ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards perhaps during the Jurassic period with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167\u00a0Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c.\u00a066 to 56\u00a0Ma ago after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction."

        "article": "Snake venom is a highly toxic saliva containing zootoxins that facilitates in the immobilization and digestion of prey.  This also provides defense against threats. Snake venom is injected by unique fangs during a bite whereas some species are also able to spit venom.The glands that secrete zootoxins are a modification of the parotid salivary glands found in other vertebrates and are usually located on each side of the head below and behind the eye and enclosed in a muscular sheath. The venom is stored in large glands called alveoli before being conveyed by a duct to the base of channeled or tubular fangs through which it's ejected.Venom contains more than 20 different compounds which are mostly proteins and polypeptides. The complex mixture of proteins enzymes and various other substances has toxic and lethal properties. Venom serves to immobilize prey. Enzymes in venom play an important role in the digestion of prey and various other substances are responsible for important but non-lethal biological effects. Some of the proteins in snake venom have very specific effects on various biological functions including blood coagulation blood pressure regulation and transmission of nerve or muscle impulses. These venoms have been studied and developed for use as pharmacological or diagnostic tools and even drugs."

        "article": "A snakebite is an injury caused by the bite of a snake especially a venomous snake. A common sign of a bite from a venomous snake is the presence of two puncture wounds from the animal's fangs. Sometimes venom injection from the bite may occur. This may result in redness swelling and severe pain at the area which may take up to an hour to appear. Vomiting blurred vision tingling of the limbs and sweating may result. Most bites are on the hands arms or legs. Fear following a bite is common with symptoms of a racing heart and feeling faint. The venom may cause bleeding kidney failure a severe allergic reaction tissue death around the bite or breathing problems. Bites may result in the loss of a limb or other chronic problems or even death.The outcome depends on the type of snake the area of the body bitten the amount of snake venom injected the general health of the person bitten and whether or not anti-venom serum has been administered by a doctor in a timely manner. Problems are often more severe in children than adults due to their smaller size. Allergic reactions to snake venom can further complicate outcomes and can include anaphylaxis requiring additional treatment and in some cases resulting in death.Snakes bite both as a method of hunting and as a means of protection. Risk factors for bites include working outside with one's hands such as in farming forestry and construction. Snakes commonly involved in envenomations include elapids (such as kraits cobras and mambas) vipers and sea snakes. The majority of snake species do not have venom and kill their prey by constriction (squeezing them). Venomous snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Determining the type of snake that caused a bite is often not possible. The World Health Organization says snakebites are a \"neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries\" and in 2017 the WHO categorized snakebite envenomation as a Neglected Tropical Disease (Category A). The WHO also estimates that between 4.5 and 5.4 million people are bitten each year and of those figures 40\u201350% develop some kind of clinical illness as a result. Furthermore the death toll of such an injury could range between 80000 and 130000 people per year. The purpose was to encourage research expand accessibility of antivenoms and improve snakebite management in \"developing countries\".Prevention of snake bites can involve wearing protective footwear avoiding areas where snakes live and not handling snakes. Treatment partly depends on the type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom cutting the wound with a knife or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends on the type of snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required.The number of venomous snakebites that occur each year may be as high as five million. They result in about 2.5 million envenomations and 20000 to 125000 deaths. The frequency and severity of bites vary greatly among different parts of the world. They occur most commonly in Africa Asia and Latin America with rural areas more greatly affected. Deaths are relatively rare in Australia Europe and North America. For example in the United States about seven to eight thousand people per year are bitten by venomous snakes (about one in 40 thousand people) and about five people die (about one death per 65 million people)."

They become concentrated as a result of human caused activities and can enter plant and animal (including human) tissues via inhalation diet and manual handling. Then they can bind to and interfere with the functioning of vital cellular components. The toxic effects of arsenic mercury and lead were known to the ancients but methodical studies of the toxicity of some heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In humans heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of chelating agents.

Most often IPEX presents with autoimmune enteropathy dermatitis (eczema) and autoimmune endocrinopathy (most often Type 1 diabetes) but other presentations exist.IPEX is caused by mutations in the gene FOXP3 which encodes transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). FOXP3 is widely considered to be the master regulator of the regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage. FOXP3 mutation can lead to the dysfunction of CD4+ Tregs. In healthy people Tregs maintain immune homeostasis. When there is a deleterious FOXP3 mutation Tregs do not function properly and cause autoimmunity.IPEX onset usually happens in infancy. If left untreated it is often fatal by the age of 2 or 3. A bone marrow transplant is generally considered the best treatment option.  IPEX exclusively affects males and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner; female carriers of pathogenic FOXP3 mutations do not have symptoms and no female cases are known."

        "article": "Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet's surface. Winds occur on a range of scales from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics and subtropics thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain mountain and valley breezes can prevail.  Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale their speed and direction the forces that cause them the regions in which they occur and their effect. Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind speed); the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy. In meteorology winds are often referred to according to their strength and the direction from which the wind is blowing. The convention for directions refer to where the wind comes from; therefore a 'western' or 'westerly' wind blows from the west to the east a 'northern' wind blows south and so on. This is sometimes counter-intuitive.Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength such as breeze gale storm and hurricane.In outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn.In human civilization the concept of wind has been explored in mythology influenced the events of history expanded the range of transport and warfare and provided a power source for mechanical work electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong trees and human-made structures can be damaged or destroyed.Winds can shape landforms via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils for example loess and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species as well as flying insect and bird populations. When combined with cold temperatures the wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores as well as their hunting and defensive strategies."

An obstruction that prevents oxygen from entering the lungs results in oxygen deprivation. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops choking often leads to death.Around 4500 to 5000 choking-related deaths occur in the United States every year. Deaths from choking most often occur in the very young (children under three years old) and in the elderly (adults over 75 years). Foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx (such as bananas marshmallows or gelatinous candies) are more dangerous. Various forms of specific first aid are used to address and resolve choking.Choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States. Many episodes go unreported because they are brief and resolve without needing medical attention. Of the reported events 80% occur in people under 15 years of age and 20% occur in people older than 15 years of age. Worldwide choking on a foreign object resulted in 162000 deaths (2.5 per 100000) in 2013 compared with 140000 deaths (2.9 per 100000) in 1990."

This is particularly evident with catheters parasites or biomaterials that are inserted into the body for replacement or regeneration of diseased or damaged tissues. Foreign body giant cells are also produced to digest foreign material that is too large for phagocytosis. The inflammatory process that creates these cells often leads to a foreign body granuloma.The human body goes through several steps when exposed to foreign biomaterial including acute and chronic inflammation and formation of new tissue and a fibrous capsule along the surface of the implantation. Foreign body reactions which are a type of chronic inflammation are characterized by the presence of macrophages monocytes and foreign-body giant cells (FBGCs). The response of the foreign body reaction determines how compatible the implanted material will be in the body and the members of the foreign body reaction including the FBGC's remain along the surface of the biomaterial for its lifetime in the body.Foreign body giant cells are formed through signaling from IL-4 and IL-13 and may fuse to produce a multinucleated cell with up to 200 nuclei within its cytoplasm."

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues. Adipose tissues are distributed throughout the body including such sites as the deep and more superficial layers of subcutaneous tissues as well as in less surgically accessible sites like the retroperitoneum (i.e. space behind the abdominal cavity) and visceral fat inside the abdominal cavity.All liposarcomas consist of at least some cells that bear a resemblance to fat cells when examined for their histopathologic appearances under a microscope. However the liposarcomas do have several forms based on differences in their clinical presentations (e.g. ages gender preferences sites of tumors signs and symptoms) severities (i.e. potential to invade local tissues recur after surgical removal and metastasize to distal tissues) genetic abnormalities prognoses and preferred treatment regimens. The World Health Organization in 2020 reclassified liposarcomas into five more or less distinct forms: 1) atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WD-LPS); 2) dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DD-LPS); 3) myxoid liposarcoma; 4) pleomorphic liposarcoma; and 5) myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma. (Pleomorphic indicates the presence of cells that have abnormal and often large variations in their size and shape and/or the size and shape of their nuclei.)While liposarcoma forms are classified as being aggressive and malignant or in the case of the atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma as relatively non-aggressive and benign all five liposarcoma forms can infiltrate locally to injure nearby tissues and organs occur in surgically inaccessible sites adjacent to vital organs (e.g. the retroperitoneum) recur after surgical removal and progress to life-threatening diseases. Studies to date find that all five liposarcoma forms while usually treatable at least initially by surgical resection are often only marginally responsive to currently used chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens. The liposarcomas require a wide range of further studies to determine their responsiveness to various radiotherapy chemotherapy and more novel treatment regimens as used individually and in various combinations that would include where possible surgical removal."

As with scarring in other organs and tissues the glial scar is the body's mechanism to protect and begin the healing process in the nervous system.In the context of neurodegeneration formation of the glial scar has been shown to have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Particularly many neuro-developmental inhibitor molecules are secreted by the cells within the scar that prevent complete physical and functional recovery of the central nervous system after injury or disease. On the other hand absence of the glial scar has been associated with impairments in the repair of the blood brain barrier."

He was created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton and animated by Andreas Deja. Scar is introduced in the first film as the ruthless power-hungry younger brother of Mufasa ruler of the Pride Lands. Originally first in line to Mufasa's throne until he is suddenly replaced by Mufasa's son Simba Scar decides to lead an army of hyenas in his plot to take the throne by killing Mufasa and Simba who escapes into exile ultimately blaming his brother's death on his nephew.Loosely based on King Claudius the main antagonist of William Shakespeare's Hamlet Scar's villainy was additionally inspired by Adolf Hitler as well as stemming from lions' natural behaviors of pride takeovers. As the character's supervising animator Deja based Scar's appearance on that of the original film voice actor Jeremy Irons as well as the actor's performance as Claus von B\u00fclow in Reversal of Fortune. Chiwetel Ejiofor voices the photorealistic version of the character in the 2019 remake of the film with Kelvin Harrison Jr. voicing him in the upcoming 2024 film.As a character Scar has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who greeted Irons's vocal performance with equal enthusiasm. However Scar's violence dark color palette and allegedly effeminate mannerisms were initially met with mild controversy. Nevertheless Scar continues to be revered as one of Disney's greatest villains by various media publications topping The Huffington Post's list and ranking within the top ten of similar lists published by Yahoo! Movies the Orlando Sentinel E! and CNN. He has also been ranked among the greatest villains in film history by Digital Spy and Entertainment Weekly."

DFSP-FS tumors have been viewed as: 1) a more aggressive form of the dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) tumors because they have areas that resemble and tend to behave like malignant fibrosarcomas or 2) as a distinctly different tumor than DFSP. DFSP-FS tumors are related to DFSP. For example surgically removed DFSP tumors often recur with newly developed fibrobosarcoma-like areas. Nonetheless the World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 classified DFSP and DFSP-FS as different tumors with DFSP being in the category of benign and DFSP-FS in the category of rarely metastasizing fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors. This article follows the WHO classification: the 5-15% of DFSP tumors that have any areas of fibrosarcomatous microscopic histopathology are here considered DFSP-FS rather than DFSP tumors.DFSP tumors typically consist of bland-appearing slowly proliferating spindle-shaped cells arranged in a monotonous cartwheel or whorled pattern. DFSP-FS tumors consist of less bland-appearing spindle-shaped cells that are arranged in fascicular (i.e. bundled smooth muscle-like) or herringbone-like patterns have large vesicular misshaped nuclei and are rapidly proliferating; these DFSP-FS areas are typically but not always admixed with DFSP areas. Various studies find that DFSP-FS tumors have higher rates of recurrence after surgical removal than DFSP tumors and may metastasize (i.e. spread to distant tissues).The tumor cells in DFSP and DFSP-FS harbor one or more fusion gene mutations i.e. mutations that merge two previously independent genes. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene is the most common fusion gene found in both tumor types. However  DFSP-FS tumor cells have higher copy numbers of the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene than do DFSP tumors.Localized DFSP-FS tumors are typically treated by wide surgical excision in order to reduce the high recurrence rates developing when these tumors' cells are not completely removed. Adjuvant therapy (i.e. therapy given in addition to the primary or initial therapy in order to maximize its effectiveness) consisting of radiation therapy and/or drugs (i.e. protein kinase inhibitors that block the effects of the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene) may be added to the treatment regimen in cases where a tumor cannot be fully removed and in virtually all cases where the tumor has metastasized."

GCF tumor tissues consist of bland spindle-shaped or stellate-shaped cells interspersed among multinucleated giant cells.GCF tumors are closely related to dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans fibrosarcomatous (DFSP-FS) (also termed fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans) tumors. The World Health Organization (2020) classified these three tumors as different tumors in the category of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors with GCF and DFSP sub-classified as benign but aggressive tumors and DFSP-FS subclassified as a rarely metastasizing tumor. However The three tumor types may contain areas that have a microscopic histopathological appearance similar to one of the other types. Furthermore following their surgical resection GCF tumors may recur as DFSP tumors and vice versa and DFSP tumors may recur as DFSP-FS tumors. CGF DFSP and DFSP-FS have been regarded as an increasingly aggressive spectrum of related tumors.Giant cell fibroblastoma tumors are typically treated by surgical resection but have a very high rate of recurrence at the sites of their resection particularly in cases where all of the tumor has not been removed. Accordingly wide complete tumor resections are the recommended treatment for them."

As they release histamine they are associated with allergic reactions.  Mast cells also respond to tissue trauma.  Mast cell granules contain histamine heparin platelet-activating factor and other substances.  Disseminated mastocytosis is rarely seen in young dogs and cats while mast cell tumors are usually skin tumors in older dogs and cats. Although not always malignant they do have the potential to be.

Mastocytoma are not only extremely common in dogs but also tend to be much more malignant in them than in other animal species. The average survival time for malignant tumors is only four months whereas for benign tumors it is over two years.Mast cells are cells of the immune system that play a role in the innate immune response. They produce a number of biologically active substances including primarily histamine. Mastocytoma account for about one-fifth of all skin tumors in dogs. They present as nodules or raised patches and about one-fifth of affected animals have ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and duodenum. Metastasis in malignant mastocytoma occur primarily in lymph nodes liver spleen and bone marrow. Any lump in the skin or subcutaneous tissue can be a mastocytoma. Detection is only possible by taking tissue with a fine needle (fine needle biopsy) followed by staining and microscopic examination (cytopathology).Although the classifications according to the clinical appearances and cell appearance in cytodiagnostics give indications of the biological behavior (benign or malignant) and thus the prospect of cure this tumor disease is unpredictable and should be treated at an early stage. The treatment of choice is complete surgical removal possibly combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Tumors for which surgical removal is not possible or only incompletely possible can also be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Mastocytoma are also more common in domestic horses ferrets and domestic cats but usually behave benignly in these species. In other animal species and in humans mastocytomas are very rare."

It is named after Guillaume Dupuytren who first described the underlying mechanism of action followed by the first successful operation in 1831 and publication of the results in The Lancet in 1834. It usually begins as small hard nodules just under the skin of the palm then worsens over time until the fingers can no longer be fully straightened. While typically not painful some aching or itching may be present. The ring finger followed by the little and middle fingers are most commonly affected. It can affect one or both hands. The condition can interfere with activities such as preparing food writing putting the hand in a tight pocket putting on gloves or shaking hands.The cause is unknown but might have a genetic component. Risk factors include family history alcoholism smoking thyroid problems liver disease diabetes previous hand trauma and epilepsy. The underlying mechanism involves the formation of abnormal connective tissue within the palmar fascia. Diagnosis is usually based on a physical exam. Blood tests or imaging studies are not usually necessary.Initial treatment is typically with a cortisone shot into the affected area occupational therapy and physical therapy. Among those who worsen clostridial collagenase injections or surgery may be tried. Radiation therapy may be used to treat this condition. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) Faculty of Clinical Oncology concluded that radiotherapy is effective in early stage disease which has progressed within the last 6 to 12 months. The condition may recur despite treatment. If it does return after treatment it can be treated again with further improvement. It is easier to treat when the amount of finger bending is more mild.It was once believed that Dupuytren's most often occurs in white males over the age of 50  and is rare among Asians and Africans. It sometimes was called \"Viking disease\" since it was often recorded among those of Nordic descent. In Norway about 30% of men over 60 years old have the condition while in the United States about 5% of people are affected at some point in time. In the United Kingdom about 20% of people over 65 have some form of the disease.More recent and wider studies show the highest prevalence in Africa (17 percent) Asia (15 percent)."

They are often seen in violin viola and cello players along with fiddler's neck and other dermatologic conditions peculiar to string musicians. Although Garrod's pads are conventionally described as appearing on the proximal interphalangeal joint distal interphalangeal joint involvement has also been described.Garrod's pads are named after Archibald Garrod who first documented them in 1904 in association with Dupuytren's contracture. H.A. Bird described them as an incidental finding in a professional violinist and proposed that they arise in such cases due to repeated extreme tension of the extensor tendons over the interphalangeal joints. Bird noted that violin players use the left hand for a markedly different task than the right hand with the extensor tendons in the left hand subjected to considerable tension and that Garrod's pads only arise on the left hand in such cases. This unilateral finding differentiates the occupational hazard of Garrod's pads from more significant disorders. Among violinists and violists Garrod's pads apparently arise as a protective mechanism for the skin and subcutaneous tissues above the tendons; Bird notes that they do not protect against external trauma unlike most calluses.Patients with Dupuytren's contracture are four times more likely to have coexisting Garrod's pads."

There are two small sesamoid bones under the first metatarsal head.  The next most frequent site of metatarsal head pain is under the second metatarsal.  This can be due to either too short a first metatarsal bone or to \"hypermobility of the first ray\" \u2013 metatarsal bone and medial cuneiform bone behind it \u2013 both of which result in excess pressure being transmitted into the second metatarsal head."

Removal may be surgical mechanical chemical autolytic (self-digestion) and by maggot therapy.In podiatry practitioners such as chiropodists podiatrists and foot health practitioners remove conditions such as calluses and verrucas.Debridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and other serious wounds; it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and spider bites.Sometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined. For example when excising a tumor there may be micrometastases along the edges of the tumor that are too small to be detected but if not removed could cause a relapse. In such circumstances a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumor is completely removed."

        "article": "Hyperbaric medicine is a medical treatment in which an increase in barometric pressure over ambient pressure is employed increasing the partial pressures of all gasses present in the compressed air. The immediate effects include reducing the size of gas embolisms and raising the partial pressures of all gasses present according to Henry's law. Currently there are two types of hyperbaric medicine depending on the gases compressed hyperbaric air and hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric air (HBA) consists of compressed room air (79% nitrogen 21% oxygen and minor gases) and is FDA-approved for acute mountain sickness. The hyperbaric air environment is created by placing the patient in a portable hyperbaric air chamber and inflating that chamber up to 7.35 psi gauge (1.5 atmospheres absolute) using a foot-operated or electric air pump. Although the mechanisms of hyperbaric air are poorly understood it is thought that it relieves hypoxemia caused by the decreased partial pressure of oxygen resulting from high altitude by increasing the partial pressure of air (including oxygen and nitrogen) simulating a descent in altitude.  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) the medical use of greater than 99% oxygen at an ambient pressure higher than atmospheric pressure and therapeutic recompression for decompression illness intended to reduce the injurious effects of systemic gas bubbles by physically reducing their size and providing improved conditions for elimination of bubbles and excess dissolved gas.The equipment required for hyperbaric oxygen treatment consists of a Pressure vessel for human occupancy which may be of rigid or flexible construction and a means of a controlled atmosphere. Operation is performed to a predetermined schedule by trained personnel who monitor the patient and may adjust the schedule as required. HBOT found early use in the treatment of decompression sickness and has also shown great effectiveness in treating conditions such as gas gangrene and carbon monoxide poisoning. More recent research has examined the possibility that it may also have value for other conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis but no significant evidence has been found.A Pressure vessel for human occupancy (PVHO) is an enclosure that is intended to be occupied by one or more persons at a pressure which differs from ambient by at least 2 pounds per square inch (0.14\u00a0bar). All chambers made for hyperbaric medicine fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Food and Drug Agency (FDA). The FDA requires hyperbaric chambers to comply with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers PVHO Codes and the National Fire Protection Association Standard 99 Health Care Facilities Code.   Hyperbaric medicine poses some inherent hazards that are mitigated by FDA-compliant equipment and trained personnel.  Serious injury can occur at pressures as low as 2 psig (13.8 kPa) if a person in the PVHO is rapidly decompressed. If oxygen is used in the hyperbaric therapy this can increase the fire hazard. This is why the FDA requires hyperbaric chambers to meet ASME PVHO and NFPA 99 standards. All chambers that meet FDA standards must have an ASME data plate and people seeking hyperbaric treatment should check to ensure the equipment and facilities are to proper standards. Therapeutic recompression is usually also provided in a hyperbaric chamber. It is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness and may also be used to treat arterial gas embolism caused by pulmonary barotrauma of ascent. In emergencies divers may sometimes be treated by in-water recompression (when a chamber is not available) if suitable diving equipment (to reasonably secure the airway) is available.A number of hyperbaric treatment schedules have been published over the years for both therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for other conditions."

        "article": "Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) also known as a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) is a therapeutic technique using a suction pump tubing and a dressing to remove excess exudate and promote healing in acute or chronic wounds and second- and third-degree burns. The therapy involves the controlled application of sub-atmospheric pressure to the local wound environment using a sealed wound dressing connected to a vacuum pump. The use of this technique in wound management started in the 1990s and this technique is often recommended for treatment of a range of wounds including dehisced surgical wounds closed surgical wounds open abdominal wounds open fractures pressure injuries or pressure ulcers diabetic foot ulcers venous insufficiency ulcers some types of skin grafts burns sternal wounds. It may also be considered after a clean surgery in a person who is obese.NPWT is performed by applying a vacuum through a special sealed dressing. The continued vacuum draws out fluid from the wound and increases blood flow to the area. The vacuum may be applied continuously or intermittently depending on the type of wound being treated and the clinical objectives. Typically the dressing is changed two to three times per week. The dressings used for the technique include foam dressings and gauze sealed with an occlusive dressing intended to contain the vacuum at the wound site. Where NPWT devices allow delivery of fluids such as saline or antibiotics to irrigate the wound intermittent removal of used fluid supports the cleaning and drainage of the wound bed.In 1995 Kinetic Concepts was the first company to have a NPWT product cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. Following increased use of the technique by hospitals in the US the procedure was approved for reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2001."

Wounds can vary greatly in their appearance depending on wound location injury mechanism depth of injury timing of onset (acute vs chronic) and wound sterility among other factors. Treatment strategies for wounds will vary based on the classification of the wound therefore it is essential that wounds be thoroughly evaluated by a healthcare professional for proper management. In normal physiology all wounds will undergo a series of steps collectively known as the wound healing process which include hemostasis inflammation proliferation and tissue remodeling.

It is perceived as a cosmetically desirable trait in some domesticated dog and cat breeds notably the pug and Persian and can be normal or abnormal in other animal species. In humans brachycephaly can appear both pathologically and non-pathologically as a result of normal human variation. It is particularly common in Mongolians and the Andamanese.In anthropology human populations have been characterized as either dolichocephalic (long-headed) mesocephalic (moderate-headed) or brachycephalic (short-headed). The usefulness of the cephalic index was questioned by Giuseppe Sergi who argued that cranial morphology provided a better means to model racial ancestry.When pathological it is known as flat head syndrome and it results from premature fusion of the coronal sutures or from external deformation. The coronal suture is the fibrous joint that unites the frontal bone with the two parietal bones of the skull. The parietal bones form the top and sides of the skull. This feature can also be a symptom of Down syndrome.There are also cases of brachycephaly associated with plagiocephaly. Brachycephaly with plagiocephaly is positional and has become more prevalent since the \"Back to Sleep\" campaign. The Back to Sleep campaign began in 1994 as a way to educate parents about ways to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The campaign was named for its recommendation to place healthy babies on their backs to sleep. Placing babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk for SIDS also known as \"cot death\" or \"crib death.\" This campaign has been successful in promoting infant back sleeping and other risk-reduction strategies to parents family members child care providers health professionals and all other caregivers of infants at the cost of increasing the incidence of this deformation of the head. It is considered a cosmetic problem. Many pediatricians remain unaware of the issue and possible treatments. Treatments include regular prone repositioning of babies (\"tummy time\")."

Commonly though not always the number and visibility of lesions is in direct proportion to the amount of sun damage to the affected area.Lesions generally are characterized by an irregularly shaped thread-like ring that is usually the size of a pencil eraser though lesions vary and may be half or double that size.  The thread-like ring is very thin much like fabric thread for sewing and raised such that it is both palpable and visible.  The interior of the ring may be rough like sandpaper or smooth.  The interior is often discolored though colors vary from patient to patient. Lesions due to their vascular nature can also vary according to body temperature environmental temperatures and other external stimuli.  The internal ring color is most often reddish purplish pink or brown.Some patients report itching and irritation associated with the condition and many report no notable sensation.

        "article": "Ultraviolet (UV) light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths of 10\u2013400 nanometers shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation is present in sunlight and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. It is also produced by electric arcs Cherenkov radiation and specialized lights such as mercury-vapor lamps tanning lamps and black lights. The photons of ultraviolet have greater energy than those of visible light from about 3.1\u00a0to\u00a012\u00a0electron volts around the minimum energy required to ionize atoms.  Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack sufficient energy it can induce chemical reactions and cause many substances to glow or fluoresce. Many practical applications including chemical and biological effects are derived from the way that UV radiation can interact with organic molecules. These interactions can involve absorption or adjusting energy states in molecules but do not necessarily involve heating.   Short-wave ultraviolet light is ionizing radiation. Consequently short-wave UV damages DNA and sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact.For humans suntan and sunburn are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV light along with an increased risk of skin cancer. The amount of UV light produced by the Sun means that the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere. More energetic shorter-wavelength \"extreme\" UV below 121\u00a0nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground. However ultraviolet light (specifically UVB) is also responsible for the formation of vitamin D in most land vertebrates including humans. The UV spectrum thus has effects both beneficial and detrimental to life.The lower wavelength limit of the visible spectrum is conventionally taken as 400\u00a0nm so ultraviolet rays are not visible to humans although people can sometimes perceive light at shorter wavelengths than this. Insects birds and some mammals can see near-UV (NUV) i.e. slightly shorter wavelengths than what humans can see."

The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia) which causes tissue damage most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract. The third stage consists of vasculitis which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening.This condition is now called \"eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\" to remove all eponyms from the vasculitides. To facilitate the transition it was referred to as \"eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg\u2013Strauss)\" for a period of time starting in 2012. Prior to this it was known as \"Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome\" named after Jacob Churg and Lotte Strauss who first published about the syndrome in 1951 using the term allergic granulomatosis to describe it. It is a type of systemic necrotizing vasculitis.Effective treatment of EGPA requires suppression of the immune system with medication.

        "article": "An autoimmune disease is a condition that results from an anomalous response of the adaptive immune system wherein it mistakenly targets and attacks healthy functioning parts of the body as if they were foreign organisms. It is estimated that there are more than 80 recognized autoimmune diseases with recent scientific evidence suggesting the existence of potentially more than 100 distinct conditions. Nearly any body part can be involved.Autoimmune diseases are a separate class from autoinflammatory diseases. Both are characterized by an immune system malfunction which may cause similar symptoms such as rash swelling or fatigue but the cardinal cause or mechanism of the diseases are different. A key difference is a malfunction of the innate immune system in autoinflammatory diseases whereas in autoimmune diseases there is a malfunction of the adaptive immune system.Symptoms of autoimmune diseases can significantly vary primarily based on the specific type of the disease and the body part that it affects. Symptoms are often diverse and can be fleeting fluctuating from mild to severe and typically comprise low-grade fever fatigue and general malaise. However some autoimmune diseases may present with more specific symptoms such as joint pain skin rashes (e.g. urticaria) or neurological symptoms.The exact causes of autoimmune diseases remain unclear and are likely multifactorial involving both genetic and environmental influences.  While some diseases like lupus exhibit familial aggregation suggesting a genetic predisposition other cases have been associated with infectious triggers or exposure to environmental factors implying a complex interplay between genes and environment in their etiology.Some of the most common diseases that are generally categorized as autoimmune include celiac disease type 1 diabetes Graves' disease inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) multiple sclerosis alopecia areata Addison's disease pernicious anemia psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Diagnosing autoimmune diseases can be challenging due to their diverse presentations and the transient nature of many symptoms.Treatment modalities for autoimmune diseases vary based on the type of disease and its severity.  Therapeutic approaches primarily aim to manage symptoms reduce immune system activity and maintain the body's ability to fight diseases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunosuppressants are commonly used to reduce inflammation and control the overactive immune response. In certain cases intravenous immunoglobulin may be administered to regulate the immune system. Despite these treatments often leading to symptom improvement they usually do not offer a cure and long-term management is often required.In terms of prevalence a UK study found that 10% of the population were affected by an autoimmune disease. Women are more commonly affected than men. Autoimmune diseases predominantly begin in adulthood although they can start at any age. The initial recognition of autoimmune diseases dates back to the early 1900s and since then advancements in understanding and management of these conditions have been substantial though much more is needed to fully unravel their complex etiology and pathophysiology."

Many species are harmless commensals or endosymbionts of hosts including humans. When mucosal barriers are disrupted or the immune system is compromised however they can invade and cause disease known as an opportunistic infection. Candida is located on most mucosal surfaces and mainly the gastrointestinal tract along with the skin. Candida albicans is one of the most commonly isolated species and can cause infections (candidiasis or thrush) in humans and other animals. In winemaking some species of Candida can potentially spoil wines.Many species are found in gut flora including C. albicans in mammalian hosts whereas others live as endosymbionts in insect hosts. Systemic infections of the bloodstream and major organs (candidemia or invasive candidiasis) particularly in patients with an impaired immune system (immunocompromised) affect over 90000 people a year in the US.The genome of several Candida species has been sequenced.Antibiotics promote yeast (fungal) infections including gastrointestinal (GI) Candida overgrowth and penetration of the GI mucosa. While women are more susceptible to genital yeast infections men can also be infected. Certain factors such as prolonged antibiotic use increase the risk for both men and women. People with diabetes or the immunocompromised such as those infected with HIV are more susceptible to yeast infections.Candida antarctica and Candida rugosa are a source of industrially important lipases while Candida krusei is prominently used to ferment cacao during chocolate production.

        "article": "Candida a comedy by playwright George Bernard Shaw was written in 1894 and first published in 1898 as part of his Plays Pleasant.  The central characters are clergyman James Morell his wife Candida and a youthful poet Eugene Marchbanks who tries to win Candida's affections. The play questions Victorian notions of love and marriage asking what a woman really desires from her husband. The cleric is a Christian Socialist allowing Shaw (who was a Fabian Socialist) to weave political issues current at the time into the story.Shaw attempted but failed to have a London production of the play put on in the 1890s but there were two small provincial productions. However in late 1903 actor Arnold Daly had such a great success with the play that Shaw would write by 1904 that New York was seeing \"an outbreak of Candidamania\". The Royal Court Theatre in London performed the play in six matinees in 1904. The same theatre staged several other of Shaw's plays from 1904 to 1907 including further revivals of Candida."

        "article": "Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast that is a common member of the human gut flora. It can also survive outside the human body. It is detected in the gastrointestinal tract and mouth in 40\u201360% of healthy adults. It is usually a commensal organism but it can become pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals under a variety of conditions. It is one of the few species of the genus Candida that cause the human infection candidiasis which results from an overgrowth of the fungus. Candidiasis is for example often observed in HIV-infected patients.C. albicans is the most common fungal species isolated from biofilms either formed on (permanent) implanted medical devices or on human tissue. C. albicans C. tropicalis C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata are together responsible for 50\u201390% of all cases of candidiasis in humans. A mortality rate of 40% has been reported for patients with systemic candidiasis due to C. albicans. By one estimate invasive candidiasis contracted in a hospital causes 2800 to 11200 deaths yearly in the US. Nevertheless these numbers may not truly reflect the true extent of damage this organism causes given new studies indicating that C. albicans can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier in mice.C. albicans is commonly used as a model organism for fungal pathogens. It is generally referred to as a dimorphic fungus since it grows both as yeast and filamentous cells. However it has several different morphological phenotypes including opaque GUT and pseudohyphal forms. C. albicans was for a long time considered an obligate diploid organism without a haploid stage. This is however not the case. Next to a haploid stage C. albicans can also exist in a tetraploid stage. The latter is formed when diploid C. albicans cells mate when they are in the opaque form. The diploid genome size is approximately 29\u00a0Mb and up to 70% of the protein coding genes have not yet been characterized.C. albicans is easily cultured in the lab and can be studied both in vivo and in vitro. Depending on the media different studies can be done as the media influences the morphological state of C. albicans. A special type of medium is CHROMagar Candida which can be used to identify different Candida species."

Often candidiasis is acquired in hospitals by patients with weakened immune systems. C.\u00a0auris can cause invasive candidiasis (fungemia) in which the bloodstream the central nervous system and internal organs are infected. It has attracted widespread attention because of its multiple drug resistance. Treatment is also complicated because it is easily misidentified as other Candida species.Candida auris was first described in 2009 after it was isolated from the ear canal of a 70-year-old Japanese woman at the Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital in Japan. In 2011 South Korea saw its first cases of disease-causing C.\u00a0auris. Reportedly this spread across Asia and Europe and first appeared in the U.S. in 2013.DNA analysis of four distinct but drug-resistant strains of Candida auris indicate an evolutionary divergence taking place at least 4000 years ago with a common leap among the four varieties into drug-resistance possibly linked to widespread azole-type antifungal use in agriculture. However explanations for its emergence remain speculative."

These microorganisms are opportunistic and in general enter the body through significant skin breakage. Gangrenous infection by soil-borne bacteria was common in the combat injuries of soldiers well into the 20th century because of non-sterile field surgery and the basic nature of care for severe projectile wounds.Other causes of myonecrosis include envenomation by snakes of the genus Bothrops (family Viperidae) ischemic necrosis caused by vascular blockage (e.g. diabetes type II) tumours that block or hoard blood supply and disseminated intravascular coagulation or other thromboses."

        "article": "A stinger (or sting) is a sharp organ found in various animals (typically insects and other arthropods) capable of injecting venom usually by piercing the epidermis of another animal.  An insect sting is complicated by its introduction of venom although not all stings are venomous.  Bites which can introduce saliva as well as additional pathogens and diseases are often confused with stings and vice versa.  Specific components of venom are believed to give rise to an allergic reaction which in turn produces skin lesions that may vary from a small itching weal or slightly elevated area of the skin to large areas of inflamed skin covered by vesicles and crusted lesions.Stinging insects produce a painful swelling of the skin the severity of the lesion varying according to the location of the sting the identity of the insect and the sensitivity of the subject. Many species of bees and wasps have two poison glands one gland secreting a toxin in which formic acid is one recognized constituent and the other secreting an alkaline neurotoxin; acting independently each toxin is rather mild but when they combine through the sting the combination has strong irritating properties. In a small number of cases the second occasion of a bee or wasp sting causes a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.While the overwhelming majority of insects withdraw their stingers from their victims a few insects leave them in the wounds. For example of the 20000 species of bees worldwide only the half-dozen species of honeybees (Apis) are reported to have a barbed stinger that cannot be withdrawn; of wasps nearly all are reported to have smooth stingers with the exception of two species Polybia rejecta and Synoeca surinama. A few non-insect arthropods such as scorpions also sting."

Infection may involve the genitals mouth or rectum. Infected men may experience pain or burning with urination discharge from the penis or testicular pain. Infected women may experience burning with urination vaginal discharge vaginal bleeding between periods or pelvic pain. Complications in women include pelvic inflammatory disease and in men include inflammation of the epididymis. Many of those infected however have no symptoms. If untreated gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves.Gonorrhea is spread through sexual contact with an infected person. This includes oral anal and vaginal sex. It can also spread from a mother to a child during birth. Diagnosis is by testing the urine urethra in males or cervix in females. Testing all women who are sexually active and less than 25 years of age each year as well as those with new sexual partners is recommended; the same recommendation applies in men who have sex with men (MSM).Gonorrhea can be prevented with the use of condoms having sex with only one person who is uninfected and by not having sex. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Retesting is recommended three months after treatment. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated.Gonorrhea affects about 0.8% of women and 0.6% of men. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI \u2013 which also includes syphilis chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Infections in women most commonly occur when they are young adults. In 2015 it caused about 700 deaths. Descriptions of the disease date back to before the Common Era within the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (Leviticus 15:2\u20133). The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before AD 200 who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\"."

The order includes about 17 living species divided into three families: Equidae (horses asses and zebras) Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses) and Tapiridae (tapirs). They typically have reduced the weight-bearing toes to three or one of the five original toes though tapirs retain four toes on their front feet. The nonweight-bearing toes are either present absent vestigial or positioned posteriorly. By contrast artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates) bear most of their weight equally on four or two (an even number) of the five toes: their third and fourth toes. Another difference between the two is that perissodactyls digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than in one or more stomach chambers as artiodactyls with the exception of Suina do.The order was considerably more diverse in the past with notable extinct groups include the brontotheres palaeotheres chalicotheres and the paraceratheres with the paraceratheres including the largest known land mammals to have ever existed.Despite their very different appearances they were recognized as related families in the 19th century by the zoologist Richard Owen who also coined the order's name."

The disease begins with a round hard swelling of the skin 2 to 5\u00a0cm (0.79 to 1.97\u00a0in) in diameter. The center may break open and form an ulcer. This initial skin lesion typically heals after 3\u20136 months. After weeks to years joints and bones may become painful fatigue may develop and new skin lesions may appear. The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open. The bones (especially those of the nose) may become misshapen. After 5 years or more large areas of skin may die leaving scars.Yaws is spread by direct contact with the fluid from a lesion of an infected person. The contact is usually of a nonsexual nature. The disease is most common among children who spread it by playing together. Other related treponemal diseases are bejel (T. pallidum endemicum) pinta (T. carateum) and syphilis (T. p. pallidum). Yaws is often diagnosed by the appearance of the lesions. Blood antibody tests may be useful but cannot separate previous from current infections. Polymerase chain reaction  is the most accurate method of diagnosis.No vaccine has yet been found. Prevention is in part done by curing those who have the disease thereby decreasing the risk of transmission. Where the disease is common treating the entire community is effective. Improving cleanliness and sanitation also decreases spread. Treatment is typically with antibiotics including azithromycin by mouth or benzathine penicillin by injection. Without treatment physical deformities occur in 10% of cases.Yaws is common in at least 13 tropical countries as of 2012. Almost 85% of infections occurred in three countries\u2014Ghana Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The disease only infects humans although 18th century French historian Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Xavier de Charlevoix describes it as a disease among geese in the Antilles. Efforts in the 1950s and 1960s by the World Health Organization  decreased the number of cases by 95%. Since then cases have increased but with renewed efforts to globally eradicate the disease by 2020. In 1995 the number of people infected was estimated at more than 500000. In 2016 the number of reported cases was 59000.

Every 17 years Brood XIII tunnels en masse to the surface of the ground mates lays eggs in tree twigs and then dies off over several weeks. Entomologist Charles Lester Marlatt published an account in 1907 in which he postulated the existence of 30 broods. The number has since been consolidated and only 15 broods of periodical cicadas are currently recognized. Of these twelve (Broods I through X XIII and XIV) are 17-year broods and three (Broods XIX XXII and XXIII) are 13-year broods. Brood XI is extinct and Brood XII is not currently recognized as a brood of 17-year cicadas.The 4 cm (1.6 in) long black bugs do not sting or bite. Once they emerge they spend their two-week lives climbing trees shedding their exoskeletons and reproducing. Brood XIII can number up to 1.5 million per acre (3.7 million per hectare). The brood is reputed to be the largest emergence of cicadas known anywhere.  The brood's most recent major emergence occurred during the spring and early summer of 2007 throughout an area roughly enclosed by northern Illinois eastern Iowa southern Wisconsin and a narrow strip of Indiana bordering Lake Michigan and Michigan. A premature emergence occurred in 2020. The brood will emerge again in late May 2024."

        "article": "The term periodical cicada is commonly used to refer to any of the seven species of the genus Magicicada of eastern North America the 13- and 17-year cicadas. They are called periodical because nearly all individuals in a local population are developmentally synchronized and emerge in the same year. Although they are sometimes called \"locusts\" this is a misnomer as cicadas belong to the taxonomic order Hemiptera (true bugs) suborder Auchenorrhyncha while locusts are grasshoppers belonging to the order Orthoptera. Magicicada belongs to the cicada tribe Lamotialnini a group of genera with representatives in Australia Africa and Asia as well as the Americas.Magicicada species spend around 99.5% of their long lives underground in an immature state called a nymph. While underground the nymphs feed on xylem fluids from the roots of deciduous forest trees in the eastern United States. In the spring of their 13th or 17th year mature cicada nymphs emerge between late April and early June (depending on latitude) synchronously and in tremendous numbers. The adults are active for only about four to six weeks after the unusually prolonged developmental phase.The males aggregate in chorus centers and call there to attract mates. Mated females lay eggs in the stems of woody plants. Within two months of the original emergence the life cycle is complete and the adult cicadas die. Later in that same summer the eggs hatch and the new nymphs burrow underground to develop for the next 13 or 17 years.Periodical emergences are also reported for the \"World Cup cicada\" Chremistica ribhoi (every four years) in northeast India and for a cicada species from Fiji Raiateana knowlesi (every eight years)."

        "article": "Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that starts in the endothelial cells that line the walls of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Since they are made from vascular lining they can appear anywhere and at any age but older people are more commonly affected and the skin is the most affected area with approximately 60% of cases being cutaneous (skin). Specifically the scalp makes up ~50% of angiosarcoma cases but this is still &lt;0.1% of all head and neck tumors. Since angiosarcoma is an umbrella term for many types of tumor that vary greatly in origin and location many symptoms may occur from completely asymptomatic to non-specific symptoms like skin lesions ulceration shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Multiple-organ involvement at time of diagnosis is common and makes it difficult to ascertain origin and how to treat it.The cause of angiosarcoma is not known though several risk factors are known such as chronic lymphedema radiation therapy and various chemicals such as arsenic and vinyl chloride. Angiosarcomas have been reported in association with long standing foreign bodies. Infrequently they have occurred in association with breast implants. Ultraviolet radiation and localized immunodeficiency may play a role in pathogenesis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma can be seen on MRI CT and ultrasound scans but it is usually difficult to discern it from other cancers requiring confirmation of diagnosis by biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis.Treatment includes surgery chemotherapy and radiation therapy usually all three combined. Because these cancers arise from the cells lining the blood or lymphatic vessels they can easily metastasize to distant sites particularly the liver and lungs. This makes them especially lethal and an early diagnosis is usually necessary for survival. Even with treatment prognosis is poor with a five-year survival rate of 30\u201338%. This is even worse in cardiac angiosarcoma and angiosarcoma of the liver where prognosis may be as low as three months.Angiosarcomas make up 1\u20132% of soft tissue sarcomas which in turn make up less than 1% of adult cancer. Due to this no large studies have ever been published on the disease with few exceeding even 100 patients; however many case reports and small cohort studies have been published and they cumulatively provide enough information to get a useful understanding of the disease. The rate of angiosarcoma is increasing in the US."

It is one of many species in the genus Latrodectus such as the Australian redback (L. hasseltii) and the North American black widow. The species is venomous to humans capable of delivering a potentially dangerous bite. It is a small to medium-sized spider with the female having a round black or brown pea-sized body. Red katip\u014d females found in the South Island and the lower half of the North Island are always black and their abdomen has a distinctive red stripe bordered in white. In black katip\u014d females found in the upper half of the North Island this stripe is absent pale yellow or replaced with cream-coloured blotches. These two forms were previously thought to be separate species. The male is much smaller than the female and quite different in appearance: white with black stripes and red diamond-shaped markings. Katip\u014d are mainly found living in sand dunes close to the seashore. They are found throughout most of coastal New Zealand except the far south and west. Katip\u014d feed mainly on ground dwelling insects caught in an irregular tangled web spun amongst dune plants or other debris.After mating in August or September the female katip\u014d produces five or six egg sacs in November or December. The spiderlings hatch during January and February and disperse into surrounding plants. Due to habitat loss and colonisation of their natural habitat by other exotic spiders the katip\u014d is threatened with extinction.A katip\u014d bite produces the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and potentially hypertension seizure or coma. Bites are rare an antivenom is available and no deaths have been reported since 1923. The katip\u014d is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known despite being rarely seen."

        "article": "The redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) also known as the Australian black widow  is a species of highly venomous spider believed to originate in South Australia or adjacent Western Australian deserts but now found throughout Australia Southeast Asia and New Zealand with colonies elsewhere outside Australia. It is a member of the cosmopolitan genus Latrodectus the widow spiders. The adult female is easily recognised by her spherical black body with a prominent red stripe on the upper side of her abdomen and an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak on the underside. Females usually have a body length of about 10 millimetres (0.4\u00a0in) while the male is much smaller being only 3\u20134\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.16\u00a0in) long.Mainly nocturnal the female redback lives in an untidy web in a warm sheltered location commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often it first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The redback spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained it is bitten repeatedly on the head body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the redback spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live on the periphery of the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of a number of arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.After mating sperm is stored in the spermathecae organs of the female reproductive tract and can be used up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in New Zealand the United Arab Emirates Japan and greenhouses in Belgium.The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans and its liking for habitats in built structures has led it to being responsible for a large number of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalised symptoms of nausea vomiting headache and agitation may also occur and indicate severe envenomation. An antivenom has been available since 1956."

There are many other terms for creams designed to protect skin from harmful substances including skin protective creams pre-work creams antisolvent gels protective ointments and shielding lotions. Three classes of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams water-soluble creams and creams designed for special applications. Barrier creams may contain substances such as zinc oxide talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. For hand care they are designed to protect against the harm from detergents and other irritants.The efficacy of barrier creams is controversial. They have not been demonstrated to be useful in preventing hand eczema. A 2018 Cochrane review concluded that the use of moisturizers alone or in combination with barrier creams may result in important protective effects for the prevention of Occupational Irritant Hand Dermatitis (OIHD). They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers. Gloves provide a greater protection than barrier creams. However they are reasonably effective for the protection of the face against some airborne substances.Some evidence suggests that improper use of barrier cream could cause a harmful rather than a beneficial effect. Skin that has been moisturized by barrier cream may be more susceptible to irritation by sodium lauryl sulfate which can permeate hydrated skin more easily because of its hydrophilia. Barrier creams that contain petroleum jelly or certain oils may cause rubber or latex gloves to deteriorate."

It is produced by plants and animals from the amino acid tryptophan. Niacin is obtained in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods with highest contents in fortified packaged foods meat poultry red fish such as tuna and salmon lesser amounts in nuts legumes and seeds. Niacin as a dietary supplement is used to treat pellagra a disease caused by niacin deficiency. Signs and symptoms of pellagra include skin and mouth lesions anemia headaches and tiredness. Many countries mandate its addition to wheat flour or other food grains thereby reducing the risk of pellagra.The amide derivative nicotinamide (niacinamide) is a component of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). Although niacin and nicotinamide are identical in their vitamin activity nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological lipid-modifying effects or side effects as niacin i.e. when niacin takes on the -amide group it does not reduce cholesterol nor cause flushing. Nicotinamide is recommended as a treatment for niacin deficiency because it can be administered in remedial amounts without causing the flushing considered an adverse effect.Niacin is also a prescription medication. Amounts far in excess of the recommended dietary intake for vitamin functions will lower blood triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and raise blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol). There are two forms: immediate-release and sustained-release niacin. Initial prescription amounts are 500\u00a0mg/day increased over time until a therapeutic effect is achieved. Immediate-release doses can be as high as 3000\u00a0mg/day; sustained-release as high as 2000\u00a0mg/day. Despite the proven lipid changes niacin has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin. A 2010 review had concluded that niacin was effective as a mono-therapy but a 2017 review incorporating twice as many trials concluded that prescription niacin while affecting lipid levels did not reduce all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality myocardial infarctions nor fatal or non-fatal strokes. Prescription niacin was shown to cause hepatotoxicity and increase risk of type 2 diabetes. Niacin prescriptions in the U.S. had peaked in 2009 at 9.4\u00a0million declining to 800\u00a0thousand by 2020.Niacin has the formula C6H5NO2 and belongs to the group of the pyridinecarboxylic acids. As the precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate niacin is involved in DNA repair."

Areas of the skin exposed to friction and radiation are typically affected first. Over time affected skin may become darker stiffen peel or bleed.There are two main types of pellagra primary and secondary. Primary pellagra is due to a diet that does not contain enough niacin and tryptophan. Secondary pellagra is due to a poor ability to use the niacin within the diet. This can occur as a result of alcoholism long-term diarrhea carcinoid syndrome Hartnup disease and a number of medications such as isoniazid. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and may be assisted by urine testing.Treatment is with either niacin or nicotinamide supplementation. Improvements typically begin within a couple of days. General improvements in diet are also frequently recommended. Decreasing sun exposure via sunscreen and proper clothing is important while the skin heals. Without treatment death may occur. The disease occurs most commonly in the developing world often as a disease of poverty associated with malnutrition specifically sub-Saharan Africa."

        "article": "Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance whose primary feature is dwarfism. It is the most common cause of dwarfism and affects about 1 in 27500 people. In those with the condition the arms and legs are short while the torso is typically of normal length. Those affected have an average adult height of 131 centimetres (4\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in) for males and 123 centimetres (4\u00a0ft) for females. Other features can include an enlarged head with prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and underdevelopment of the midface (midface hypoplasia). Complications can include sleep apnea or recurrent ear infections. Achondroplasia includes the extremely rare short-limb skeletal dysplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency.Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in its protein being overactive. Achondroplasia results in impaired endochondral bone growth (bone growth within cartilage). The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases occur in children of parents without the disease and result from a new (de novo or sporadic) mutation which most commonly originates as a spontaneous change during spermatogenesis. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the clinical features but may be confirmed by genetic testing. Mutations in FGFR3 also cause achondroplasia related conditions including hypochondroplasia and SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans) a rare disorder of bone growth characterized by skeletal brain and skin abnormalities resulting in severe short-limb skeletal dysplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency.Treatments include small molecule therapy with a C-natriuretic peptide analog (vosoritide) approved to improve growth velocity in children with achondroplasia based on results in Phase 3 human trials although its long-term effects are unknown. Growth hormone therapy may also be used. Efforts to treat or prevent complications such as obesity hydrocephalus obstructive sleep apnea middle ear infections or spinal stenosis may be required. Support groups support people with achondroplasia including the Little People of America (LPA) and Growing Stronger. Nonprofit physician organizations also exist to disseminate information about treatment and management options including development of patient resources. "

Oligogenic inheritance represents an intermediate between monogenic inheritance in which a trait is determined by a single causative gene and polygenic inheritance in which a trait is influenced by many genes and often environmental factors.Historically many traits were thought to be governed by a single causative gene (in what is deemed monogenic inheritance) however work in genetics revealed that these traits are comparatively rare and in most cases so-called monogenic traits are predominantly influenced by one gene but can be mediated by other genes of small effect."

Within the Arthropoda they belong in the subclass Acari (or Acarina) and species belonging to the Acari are informally known as acarines. Although both acarines and insects (class Insecta) are studied in the fields of veterinary and medical parasitology acarines are separated from insects by structure feeding lifecycles and disease relations. Both livestock and companion animals are susceptible to mite infestation and although this article will focus on livestock the two are similar. Humans also may become infested by contagion from these domestic animals (a zoonosis). Infestation by mites usually causes skin diseases known as mange scab demodecosis or in general as acariasis.

        "article": "Cold injury (or cold weather injury) is damage to the body from cold exposure including hypothermia and several skin injuries. Cold-related skin injuries are categorized into freezing and nonfreezing cold injuries. Freezing cold injuries involve tissue damage when exposed to temperatures below freezing (less than 0 degrees Celsius). Nonfreezing cold injuries involve tissue damage when exposed to temperatures often between 0-15 degrees Celsius for extended periods of time. While these injuries have disproportionally affected military members recreational winter activities have also increased the risk and incidence within civilian populations. Additional risk factors include homelessness inadequate or wet clothing alcohol abuse or tobacco abuse and pre-existing medical conditions that impair blood flow.Freezing cold skin injuries include frostbite and frostnip. These injuries often affect the fingers toes nose and ears since they are less commonly covered by clothing when in cold environments. Affected skin becomes numb turns white or blue and develops blisters. Frostnip is a superficial skin injury that won't freeze the skin or cause long-term damage. Frostbite involves freezing of fluids inside and outside of cells that results in cell breakdown electrolyte imbalances and inflammation. Surrounding blood vessel constriction and injury disrupts blood flow to affected tissue which may cause tissue death (necrosis). Diagnosis is based on symptoms but imaging can help assess viable tissue and risk of amputation. Pre-hospital treatment involves transfer to a warm environment changing wet clothing and rapid rewarming with warm water if refreezing is not expected. Hospital management involves rewarming wound care and medications to treat pain and possible blood clots. Amputation of unsalvageable tissue may be required weeks to months after initial injury.Nonfreezing cold skin injuries include trench foot a subclass of immersion foot caused by exposure to cold temperatures. These injuries often affect the feet after being subjected to wet cold for several hours or days. Affected individuals report a tingling or numbing sensation red or blue discoloration and swelling or blisters in affected skin. The mechanism of injury isn't fully understood but may involve cold-induced damage to blood vessels and nerves that results in small blood vessel (capillary) destruction swelling and tissue necrosis. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. Pre-hospital treatment includes transfer to a warm environment and exchanging wet clothing. Hospital management includes gradual rewarming with air drying elevating affected skin and pain management."

        "article": "Frostbite is a skin injury that occurs when exposed to extremely low temperatures causing the freezing of the skin or other tissues commonly affecting the fingers toes nose ears cheeks and chin areas. Most often frostbite occurs in the hands and feet. The initial symptoms are typically a feeling of cold and tingling or numbing. This may be followed by clumsiness with a white or bluish color to the skin. Swelling or blistering may occur following treatment. Complications may include hypothermia or compartment syndrome.People who are exposed to low temperatures for prolonged periods such as winter sports enthusiasts military personnel and homeless individuals are at greatest risk. Other risk factors include drinking alcohol smoking mental health problems certain medications and prior injuries due to cold. The underlying mechanism involves injury from ice crystals and blood clots in small blood vessels following thawing. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. Severity may be divided into superficial (1st and 2nd degree) or deep (3rd and 4th degree). A bone scan or MRI may help in determining the extent of injury.Prevention consists of wearing proper fully-covering clothing avoiding low temperatures and wind maintaining hydration and nutrition and sufficient physical activity to maintain core temperature without exhaustion. Treatment is by rewarming by immersion in warm water (near body temperature) or by body contact and should be done only when consistent temperature can be maintained so that refreezing is not a risk. Rapid heating or cooling should be avoided since it could potentially cause burning or heart stress. Rubbing or applying force to the affected areas should be avoided as it may cause further damage such as abrasions. The use of ibuprofen and tetanus toxoid is recommended for pain relief or to reduce swelling or inflammation. For severe injuries iloprost or thrombolytics may be used. Surgery is sometimes necessary. Amputation should be considered a few months after exposure in order to consider whether the extent of injury is permanent damage and thus necessitates drastic treatment.Evidence of frostbite occurring in people dates back 5000 years. Evidence was documented in a pre-Columbian mummy discovered in the Andes. The number of cases of frostbite is unknown. Rates may be as high as 40% a year among those who mountaineer. The most common age group affected is those 30 to 50 years old. Frostbite has also played an important role in a number of military conflicts. The first formal description of the condition was in 1813 by Dominique Jean Larrey a physician in Napoleon's army during its invasion of Russia."

The condition is traditionally associated with a combination of three features; bulging eyes breakdown of bone (lytic bone lesions often in the skull) and diabetes insipidus (excessive thirst and passing urine) although around 75% of cases do not have all three features. Other features may include a fever and weight loss and depending on the organs involved there may be rashes asymmetry of the face ear infections signs in the mouth and the appearance of advanced gum disease. Features relating to lung and liver disease may occur.It is due to a genetic mutation in the MAPKinase pathway that occurs during early development. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and MRI and confirmed by tissue biopsy. Blood tests may show anaemia and less commonly a low white blood cell count and low platelet count.Treatment may involve surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy and certain medicines.Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease was named for the American pediatrician Alfred Hand Jr. the Austrian neuroradiologist Arthur Sch\u00fcller and the American internist Henry Asbury Christian who described it in 1893 1915 and 1919 respectively. Before the Histiocyte Society classified histiocytoses in the 1980s the condition was also known as \"Histiocytosis X\" where \"X\" denoted the then unknown cause. It is now known as chronic multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis a subtype of LCH.The disease is rare. Most present between the ages of two and six. The outlook depends on how many and how much organs are affected. In some people the condition is life-threatening."

LCH is part of a group of syndromes called histiocytoses which are characterized by an abnormal proliferation of histiocytes (an archaic term for activated dendritic cells and macrophages). These diseases are related to other forms of abnormal proliferation of white blood cells such as leukemias and lymphomas.The disease has gone by several names including Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease Hashimoto-Pritzker disease (a very rare self-limiting variant seen at birth) and histiocytosis X until it was renamed in 1985 by the Histiocyte Society."

It presents as bright redness in the skin and can be accompanied by pain difficulty defecating itching and bleeding. This disease is considered a complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI) because of the involvement of the deeper soft tissues.Perianal cellulitis is most commonly caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) which resides normally (\"in small numbers\") in the human throat and on the human skin. Other less common causes may include infection with group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) a bacterium found in the human vagina of some or Staphylococcus aureus a common component of the bacterial community in the human nose and/or skin.Perianal cellulitis occurs mainly in male children between six months and 10 years of age however there are documented cases of perianal cellulitis in adults as well. Oral antibiotics are the first line treatment for perianal cellulitis and may be used in combination with topical antibiotics. Since the infection occurs within the deeper layers of skin using a topical treatment by itself may not be effective. In about 20% of cases recurrence of perianal streptococcal dermatitis infection occurs within 3.5 months. Routine hygiene practices should also be encouraged in children and adults in order to reduce the risk of recurrent infection."

It is given by slow injection into a vein typically at six- to eight-week intervals.Common side effects include infections acute infusion reactions and abdominal pain. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody biologic. It seems to work by binding to and neutralizing TNF-\u03b1 preventing it from interacting with its receptors on the cell. TNF-\u03b1 is a chemical messenger (cytokine) and a key part of the autoimmune reaction.Infliximab was originally developed in mice as a mouse antibody. Because humans have immune reactions to mouse proteins the mouse common domains were replaced with similar human antibody domains. They are monoclonal antibodies and have identical structures and affinities to the target. Because they are a combination of mouse and human antibody amino acid sequences they are called a \"chimeric monoclonal antibody\".Infliximab was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998 and in the European Union in August 1999. Infliximab biosimilars have been approved in the EU (2013) in Japan (2014) and in the United States (2016 2017 2019). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines."

The tail is prescribed to be slightly thick and tapering to a point. The coat is required by the ADBA to be glossy smooth short and stiff to the touch. Many colors color patterns and combinations of colors are acceptable to the ADBA except that both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo.Despite the colloquial use of the term \"pit bull\" to encompass a whole category of dogs and the legal use of the term to include several breeds in legislation some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit Bull Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only true \"pit bull\" and the only breed that should be denominated as such.Twelve countries in Europe as well as Australia Canada some parts of the United States Ecuador Malaysia New Zealand Puerto Rico Singapore and Venezuela have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull\u2013type dogs including American Pit Bull Terriers ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership. Several states in Australia place restrictions on the breed including mandatory sterilization.

Like zinc it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann both in Germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate.Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel and cadmium compounds are used as red orange and yellow pigments to color glass and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive) and nickel\u2013cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel\u2013metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is in cadmium telluride solar panels.Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms."

They are called \"end plates\" because the postsynaptic terminals of muscle fibers have a large saucer-like appearance.  When an action potential reaches the axon terminal of a motor neuron vesicles carrying neurotransmitters (mostly acetylcholine) are exocytosed and the contents are released into the neuromuscular junction.  These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and lead to its depolarization.  In the absence of an action potential acetylcholine vesicles spontaneously leak into the neuromuscular junction and cause very small depolarizations in the postsynaptic membrane. This small response (~0.4mV) is called a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) and is generated by one acetylcholine-containing vesicle.  It represents the smallest possible depolarization which can be induced in a muscle."

        "article": "Exosomes ranging in size from 30 to 150 nanometers are membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are produced in the endosomal compartment of most eukaryotic cells.  In multicellular organisms exosomes and other EVs are found in biological fluids including saliva blood urine and cerebrospinal fluid. EVs have specialized functions in physiological processes from coagulation and waste management to intercellular communication. Exosomes are formed through  the inward budding of a late endosome also known as a multivesicular body (MVB). The intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the multivesicular body (MVB) bud inward into the endosomal lumen. If the MVB fuses with the cell surface (the plasma membrane) these ILVs are released as exosomes.Exosomes were also identified within the tissue matrix coined Matrix-Bound Nanovesicles (MBV). They are also released in vitro by cultured cells into their growth medium. Enriched with a diverse array of biological elements from their source cells exosomes contain proteins (such as adhesion molecules cytoskeletons cytokines ribosomal proteins growth factors and metabolic enzymes) lipids (including cholesterol lipid rafts and ceramides) and nucleic acids (such as DNA mRNA and miRNA).Since the size of exosomes is limited by that of the parent MVB exosomes are generally thought to be smaller than most other EVs from about 30 to 150 nanometres (nm) in diameter: around the same size as many lipoproteins but much smaller than cells.Compared with EVs in general it is unclear whether exosomes have unique characteristics or functions or can be separated or distinguished effectively from other EVs. EVs in circulation carry genetic material and proteins from their cell of origin proteo-transcriptomic signatures that act as biomarkers. In the case of cancer cells exosomes may show differences in size shape morphology and canonical markers from their donor cells. They may encapsulate relevant information that can be used for disease detection. Consequently there is a growing interest in clinical applications of EVs as biomarkers and therapies alike prompting establishment of an International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) and a scientific journal devoted to EVs the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles."

        "article": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited particles that are naturally released from almost all types of  cells but unlike a cell cannot replicate. EVs range in diameter from near the size of the smallest physically possible unilamellar liposome (around 20-30 nanometers) to as large as 10 microns or more although the vast majority of EVs are smaller than 200\u00a0nm. EVs can be divided according to size and synthesis route into exosomes microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. The composition of EVs varies depending on their parent cells encompassing proteins (e.g. adhesion molecules cytoskeletons cytokines ribosomal proteins growth factors and metabolic enzymes) lipids (including cholesterol lipid rafts and ceramides) nucleic acids (such as DNA mRNA and miRNA) metabolites and even organelles. Most cells that have been studied to date are thought to release EVs including some archaeal bacterial fungal and plant cells that are surrounded by cell walls. A wide variety of EV subtypes have been proposed defined variously by size biogenesis pathway cargo cellular source and function leading to a historically heterogenous nomenclature including terms like exosomes and ectosomes.Numerous functions of EVs have been established or postulated. The first evidence for the existence of EVs was enabled by the ultracentrifuge the electron microscope and functional studies of coagulation in the mid-20th century. A sharp increase in interest in EVs occurred in the first decade of the 21st century following the discovery that EVs could transfer nucleic acids such as RNA from cell to cell. Associated with EVs from certain cells or tissues nucleic acids could be easily amplified as markers of disease and also potentially traced back to a cell of origin such as a tumor cell. When EVs are taken up by other cells they may alter the behaviour of the recipient cell for instance EVs released by colorectal cancer cells increase migration of fibroblasts and thus EVs are of importance in forming tumour landscapes. This discovery also implied that EVs could be used for therapeutic purposes such as delivering nucleic acids or other cargo to diseased tissue. Conversely pharmacological inhibition of EV release through Calix[6]arene can slow down progression of experimental pancreatic cancer. The growing interest in EVs as a nexus for therapeutic intervention was paralleled by formation of companies and funding programs focused on development of EVs as biomarkers or therapies of disease the founding of an International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) and establishment of a scientific journal devoted to the field the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles."

Due to their hydrophobicity and/or hydrophilicity biocompatibility particle size and many other properties liposomes can be used as drug delivery vehicles for administration of pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients such as lipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines and DNA vaccines.  Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes (such as by sonication).Liposomes are most often composed of phospholipids especially phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol but may also include other lipids such as those found in egg and phosphatidylethanolamine as long as they are compatible with lipid bilayer structure. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to desired cells or tissues.Based on vesicle structure there are seven main categories for liposomes: multilamellar large (MLV) oligolamellar (OLV) small unilamellar (SUV) medium-sized unilamellar (MUV) large unilamellar (LUV) giant unilamellar (GUV) and multivesicular vesicles (MVV). The major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle (MLV with several lamellar phase lipid bilayers) the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV with one lipid bilayer) the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) and the cochleate vesicle. A less desirable form is multivesicular liposomes in which one vesicle contains one or more smaller vesicles.Liposomes should not be confused with lysosomes or with micelles and reverse micelles. In contrast to liposomes micelles typically contain a monolayer of fatty acids or surfactants. "

N-Linked oligosaccharides are always pentasaccharides attached to asparagine via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain. Alternately O-linked oligosaccharides are generally attached to threonine or serine on the alcohol group of the side chain. Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids.  Some such as the raffinose series occur as storage or transport carbohydrates in plants.

It is found in all male mammals. It differs between species anatomically chemically and physiologically. Anatomically the prostate is found below the bladder with the urethra passing through it. It is described in gross anatomy as consisting of lobes and in microanatomy by zone. It is surrounded by an elastic fibromuscular capsule and contains glandular tissue as well as connective tissue.The prostate glands produce and contain fluid that forms part of semen the substance emitted during ejaculation as part of the male sexual response. This prostatic fluid is slightly alkaline milky or white in appearance. The alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract prolonging the lifespan of sperm. The prostatic fluid is expelled in the first part of ejaculate together with most of the sperm because of the action of smooth muscle tissue within the prostate. In comparison with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly seminal vesicular fluid those in prostatic fluid have better motility longer survival and better protection of genetic material.Disorders of the prostate include enlargement inflammation infection and cancer. The word prostate comes from Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 prost\u00e1t\u0113s meaning \"one who stands before\" \"protector\" \"guardian\" with the term originally used to describe the seminal vesicles."

It was Auspitz's mentor at the Medical University of Vienna (Ferdinand von Hebra) and Parisian dermatologist Marie Devergie who first noted the punctate hemorrhages underlying psoriasis scales.This pinpoint bleeding results from a thinning of the epidermal layer overlying the tips of the dermal papillae. Blood vessels within the papillae are dilated and tortuous and often bleed readily when the scale is removed.Although classically associated with psoriasis subsequent research has found Auspitz's sign to be of very little diagnostic value for the disease. This is because several other diseases display the sign (including Darier's disease and actinic keratosis). Additionally only a minority of psoriasis scales show it when removed (&lt;18%). This overall indicates that Auspitz's sign is neither highly sensitive nor specific for psoriasis and thus should only be used in combination with other findings to make a diagnosis."

It is an autoimmune disease and a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-size vessels in many organs but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract lungs and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye.  Damage to the heart lungs and kidneys can be fatal.The cause of GPA is unknown. Genetics have been found to play a role in GPA though the risk of inheritance appears to be low.GPA treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Severe disease is typically treated with a combination of immunosuppressive medications such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide and high-dose corticosteroids to control the symptoms of the disease and azathioprine methotrexate or rituximab to keep the disease under control. Plasma exchange is also used in severe cases with damage to the lungs kidneys or intestines.The number of new cases of GPA each year is estimated to be 2.1\u201314.4 new cases per million people in Europe. GPA is rare in Japanese and African-American populations but occurs more often in people of Northern European descent. GPA is estimated to affect 3 cases per 100000 people in the United States and equally affects men and women. GPA has infrequently been reported in minors."

        "article": "A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all life forms from animals and plants to microorganisms including bacteria and archaea. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898 more than 11000 of the millions of virus species have been described in detail.  The study of viruses is known as virology a subspeciality of microbiology.When infected a host cell is often forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus. When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell viruses exist in the form of independent viral particles or virions consisting of (i) genetic material i.e. long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a protein coat the capsid which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside envelope of lipids. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria.The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are still unclear. Some viruses may have evolved from plasmids which are pieces of DNA that can move between cells. Other viruses may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction. Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form because they carry genetic material reproduce and evolve through natural selection although they lack the key characteristics such as cell structure that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\" and as replicators.Viruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. Many viruses spread in the air by coughing and sneezing including influenza viruses SARS-CoV-2 chickenpox smallpox and measles. Norovirus and rotavirus common causes of viral gastroenteritis are transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is fewer than 100 particles. HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range: this is narrow for viruses specialized to infect only a few species or broad for viruses capable of infecting many.Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. Some viruses including those that cause HIV/AIDS HPV infection and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed."

It is a facultative intracellular microbe that targets red blood cells. One study showed it invaded the mature blood cells of humans. It infects the host cell by sticking to it using trimeric autotransporter adhesins.   In the United States about 20000 cases are diagnosed each year most under 15 years old.

        "article": "Inflammation (from Latin: inflammatio) is part of the biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens damaged cells or irritants. The five cardinal signs are heat pain redness swelling and loss of function (Latin calor dolor rubor tumor and functio laesa). Inflammation is a generic response and therefore is considered a mechanism of innate immunity whereas adaptive immunity is specific to each pathogen. Inflammation is a protective response involving immune cells blood vessels and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury clear out damaged cells and tissues and initiate tissue repair. Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g. bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism. However inflammation can also have negative effects. Too much inflammation in the form of chronic inflammation is associated with various diseases such as hay fever periodontal disease atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis.Inflammation can be classified as acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (in particular granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response involving the local vascular system the immune system and various cells in the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation known as chronic inflammation leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation such as mononuclear cells and involves simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue.Inflammation has also been classified as Type 1 and Type 2 based on the type of cytokines and helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) involved.The term inflammation is not a synonym for infection. Infection describes the interaction between the action of microbial invasion and the reaction of the body's inflammatory response\u2014the two components are considered together in discussion of infection and the word is used to imply a microbial invasive cause for the observed inflammatory reaction. Inflammation on the other hand describes just the body's immunovascular response regardless of cause. But because of the two are often correlated words ending in the suffix -itis (which means inflammation) are sometimes informally described as referring to infection: for example the word urethritis strictly means only \"urethral inflammation\" but clinical health care providers usually discuss urethritis as a urethral infection because urethral microbial invasion is the most common cause of urethritis.However the inflammation\u2013infection distinction is crucial in situations in pathology and medical diagnosis that involve inflammation that is not driven by microbial invasion such as cases of atherosclerosis trauma ischemia and autoimmune diseases (including type III hypersensitivity)."

It is also referred to as a Herculean or bodybuilder-like appearance. It may be the result of muscle inflammation (immunity-related swelling) muscle hyperplasia muscle hypertrophy muscle pseudohypertrophy (muscle atrophy with infiltration of fat or other tissue) or symmetrical subcutaneous (under the skin) deposits of fat or other tissue.The mechanism resulting in this sign may stay consistent or may change while the sign itself remains. For instance some individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy may start with true muscle hypertrophy but later develop into pseudohypertrophy.In healthy individuals resistance training and heavy manual labour creates muscle hypertrophy through signalling from mechanical stimulation (mechanotransduction) and from sensing available energy reserves (such as AMP through AMP-activated protein kinase); however in the absence of a sports or vocational explanation for muscle hypertrophy especially with accompanying muscle symptoms (such as myalgia cramping or exercise intolerance) then a neuromuscular disorder should be suspected.As muscle hypertrophy is a response to strenuous anaerobic activity ordinary everyday activity would become strenuous in diseases that result in premature muscle fatigue (neural or metabolic) or disrupt the excitation-contraction coupling in muscle or cause repetitive or sustained involuntary muscle contractions (fasciculations myotonia or spasticity). In lipodystrophy an abnormal deficit of subcutaneous fat accentuates the appearance of the muscles though in some forms the muscles are quantifiably hypertrophic (possibly due to a metabolic abnormality)."

Signs and symptoms can range from none to mild (headaches muscle pains and fevers) to severe (bleeding in the lungs or meningitis). Weil's disease ( VILES) the acute severe form of leptospirosis causes the infected individual to become jaundiced (skin and eyes become yellow) develop kidney failure and bleed. Bleeding from the lungs associated with leptospirosis is known as severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome.More than ten genetic types of Leptospira cause disease in humans. Both wild and domestic animals can spread the disease most commonly rodents. The bacteria are spread to humans through animal urine or feces or water or soil contaminated with animal urine and feces coming into contact with the eyes mouth nose or breaks in the skin. In developing countries the disease occurs most commonly in pest control farmers and low-income people who live in areas with poor sanitation. In developed countries it occurs during heavy downpours and is a risk to pest controllers sewage workers and those involved in outdoor activities in warm and wet areas. Diagnosis is typically by testing for antibodies against the bacteria or finding bacterial DNA in the blood.Efforts to prevent the disease include protective equipment to block contact when working with potentially infected animals washing after contact and reducing rodents in areas where people live and work. The antibiotic doxycycline is effective in preventing leptospirosis infection. Human vaccines are of limited usefulness; vaccines for other animals are more widely available. Treatment when infected is with antibiotics such as doxycycline penicillin or ceftriaxone. The overall risk of death is 5\u201310%. However when the lungs are involved the risk of death increases to the range of 50\u201370%.It is estimated that one million severe cases of leptospirosis in humans occur every year causing about 58900 deaths. The disease is most common in tropical areas of the world but may occur anywhere. Outbreaks may arise after heavy rainfall. The disease was first described by physician Adolf Weil in 1886 in Germany. Infected animals may have no mild or severe symptoms. These may vary by the type of animal. In some animals Leptospira live in the reproductive tract leading to transmission during mating."

All members of the genus produce the skin-irritating oil urushiol which can cause a severe allergic reaction. The generic name is derived from the Greek words \u03c4\u03bf\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (toxikos) meaning \"poison\" and \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (dendron) meaning \"tree\". The best known members of the genus in North America are poison ivy (T. radicans) practically ubiquitous throughout most of eastern North America and western poison oak (T. diversilobum) similarly ubiquitous throughout much of the western part of the continent.The genus is a member of the Rhus complex and has at various times been categorized as being either its own genus or a sub-genus of Rhus. There is evidence which points to keeping Toxicodendron as a separate monophyletic genus but researchers have stated that the Toxicodendron and Rhus groups are complex and require more study to be fully understood.Plants in the genus have pinnately compound alternate leaves and whitish or grayish drupes. They are quite variable in appearance. The leaves may have smooth toothed or lobed edges and all three types of leaf edges may be present in a single plant. The plants grow as creeping vines climbing vines shrubs or in the case of lacquer tree (T. vernicifluum) and poison sumac (T. vernix) as trees. While leaves of poison ivy and poison oaks usually have three leaflets sometimes there are five or occasionally even seven leaflets. Leaves of poison sumac have 7\u201313 leaflets and of Lacquer Tree 7\u201319 leaflets.The common names come from similar appearances to other species that are not closely related and to the allergic response to the urushiol. Poison oak is not an oak (Quercus family Fagaceae) but this common name comes from the leaves' resemblance to white oak (Quercus alba) leaves while poison ivy is not an ivy (Hedera family Araliaceae) but has a superficially similar growth form. Technically the plants do not contain a poison; they contain a potent allergen.The resins of certain species native to Japan China and other Asian countries such as lacquer tree (T. vernicifluum) and wax tree (T. succedaneum) are used to make lacquer and as a byproduct of lacquer manufacture their berries are used to make japan wax."

In up to 80% of cases symptoms are associated with psychological trauma or psychological stress. AMPS may also follow physical injury or illness. Other associations with AMPS include Ehlers-danlos syndrome myositis arthritis and other rheumatologic diseases. Treatment for notable pain intensity without identifiable pathophysiology can include psychotherapy to alleviate psychological stress. Physical therapists psychologically informed physical therapists in particular can coach people on exercises they can do everyday at home. The prognosis for the condition is very positive with the ability for majority of effected individuals to recover completely but the management of the condition is a gradual improvement over time which can leave many individuals feeling a lack of motivation or progress in their AMPS management. Clinicians who use this diagnosis sometimes apply it to children and adolescents. To date this diagnosis is used more in women."

It can affect a person's ability to lift pull and push weighty objects. In some serious cases the ability to perform activities of daily living such as changing one's clothes and washing one's hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance a wing-like resemblance due to the medial border of the scapula sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt scapulohumeral rhythm contributing to decreased flexion and abduction of the upper extremity as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain. A winged scapula is considered normal posture in young children but not older children and adults."

        "article": "Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever increased heart rate increased breathing rate and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection such as a cough with pneumonia or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young old and people with a weakened immune system may have no symptoms of a specific infection and the body temperature may be low or normal instead of having a fever. Severe sepsis causes poor organ function or blood flow. The presence of low blood pressure high blood lactate or low urine output may suggest poor blood flow. Septic shock is low blood pressure due to sepsis that does not improve after fluid replacement.Sepsis is caused by many organisms including bacteria viruses and fungi. Common locations for the primary infection include the lungs brain urinary tract skin and abdominal organs. Risk factors include being very young or old a weakened immune system from conditions such as cancer or diabetes major trauma and burns. Previously a sepsis diagnosis required the presence of at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the setting of presumed infection. In 2016 a shortened sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score) known as the quick SOFA score (qSOFA) replaced the SIRS system of diagnosis. qSOFA criteria for sepsis include at least two of the following three: increased breathing rate change in the level of consciousness and low blood pressure. Sepsis guidelines recommend obtaining blood cultures before starting antibiotics; however the diagnosis does not require the blood to be infected. Medical imaging is helpful when looking for the possible location of the infection. Other potential causes of similar signs and symptoms include anaphylaxis adrenal insufficiency low blood volume heart failure and pulmonary embolism.Sepsis requires immediate treatment with intravenous fluids and antimicrobials. Ongoing care often continues in an intensive care unit. If an adequate trial of fluid replacement is not enough to maintain blood pressure then the use of medications that raise blood pressure becomes necessary. Mechanical ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys respectively. A central venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be placed for access to the bloodstream and to guide treatment. Other helpful measurements include cardiac output and superior vena cava oxygen saturation. People with sepsis need preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis stress ulcers and pressure ulcers unless other conditions prevent such interventions. Some people might benefit from tight control of blood sugar levels with insulin. The use of corticosteroids is controversial with some reviews finding benefit and others not.Disease severity partly determines the outcome. The risk of death from sepsis is as high as 30% while for severe sepsis it is as high as 50% and septic shock 80%. Sepsis affected about 49 million people in 2017 with 11 million deaths (1 in 5 deaths worldwide). In the developed world approximately 0.2 to 3 people per 1000 are affected by sepsis yearly resulting in about a million cases per year in the United States. Rates of disease have been increasing. Some data indicate that sepsis is more common among males than females however other data show a greater prevalence of the disease among women. Descriptions of sepsis date back to the time of Hippocrates."

EHS has no scientific basis and is not a recognized medical diagnosis although it is generally accepted that the experience of EHS symptoms is of psychosomatic origin. Claims are characterized by a \"variety of non-specific symptoms which afflicted individuals attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields\". Attempts to justify the claim that EHS is caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields have amounted to pseudoscience.Those who are self-described with EHS report adverse reactions to electromagnetic fields at intensities well below the maximum levels permitted by international radiation safety standards.  Provocation trials have found that such claimants are unable to distinguish between exposure and non-exposure to electromagnetic fields. A systematic review of medical research in 2011 found no convincing scientific evidence for symptoms being caused by electromagnetic fields. Since then several double-blind experiments have shown that people who report electromagnetic hypersensitivity are unable to detect the presence of electromagnetic fields and are as likely to report ill health following a sham exposure as they are following exposure to genuine electromagnetic fields suggesting the cause in these cases is the nocebo effect.As of 2005 the WHO recommended that claims of EHS be clinically evaluated to determine and rule out alternative diagnoses for suffered symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy and management of co-morbid psychiatric disorders may be helpful in managing the condition.Some people who feel they are sensitive to electromagnetic fields may seek to reduce their exposure or use alternative medicine. Government agencies have enforced false advertising claims against companies selling devices to shield against EM radiation."

It is an abnormality in the immune system that causes immune diseases including allergies and autoimmunity. It is caused by many types of particles and substances from the external environment or from within the body that are recognized by the immune cells as antigens. The immune reactions are usually referred to as an over-reaction of the immune system and they are often damaging and uncomfortable. In 1963 Philip George Houthem Gell and Robin Coombs introduced a systematic classification of the different types of hypersensitivity based on the types of antigens and immune responses involved. According to this system known as the Gell and Coombs classification or Gell-Coombs's classification there are four types of hypersensitivity namely type I which is an IgE mediated immediate reaction; type II an antibody-mediated reaction mainly involving IgG or IgM; type III an immune complex-mediated reaction involving IgG complement system and phagocytes; type IV a cytotoxic cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction involving T cells.The first three types are considered immediate hypersensitivity reactions because they occur within 24 hours. The fourth type is considered a delayed hypersensitivity reaction because it usually occurs more than 12 hours after exposure to the allergen with a maximal reaction time between 48 and 72 hours. Hypersensitivity is a common occurrence it is estimated that about 15% of humans have at least one type during their lives and has increased since the latter half of the 20th century."

Unlike the other types it is not humoral (not antibody-mediated) but rather is a type of cell-mediated response. This response involves the interaction of T\u00a0cells monocytes and macrophages.This reaction is caused when CD4+ Th1\u00a0cells recognize foreign antigen in a complex with the MHC class II on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. These can be macrophages that secrete IL-12 which stimulates the proliferation of further CD4+ Th1\u00a0cells. CD4+ T\u00a0cells secrete IL-2 and interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) inducing the further release of other Th1 cytokines thus mediating the immune response. Activated CD8+ T\u00a0cells destroy target cells on contact whereas activated macrophages produce hydrolytic enzymes and on presentation with certain intracellular pathogens transform into multinucleated giant cells.The overreaction of the helper T\u00a0cells and overproduction of cytokines damage tissues cause inflammation and cell death. Type IV hypersensitivity can usually be resolved with topical corticosteroids and trigger avoidance."

This behavior is found in toothed animals such as mammals reptiles amphibians fish and arthropods. Biting is also an action humans participate in commonly when chewing food. Myocytic contraction of the muscles of mastication is responsible for generating the force that initiates the preparatory jaw abduction (opening) then rapidly adducts (closes) the jaw and moves the top and bottom teeth towards each other resulting in the forceful action of a bite.Biting is one of the main functions in most macro-organisms' life providing them the ability to forage hunt eat build play fight and protect and much more. Biting may be a form of physical aggression due to predatory or territorial intentions. In animals it can also be a normal activity as they eat carries objects softens and prepares food for its young removes ectoparasites or irritating foreign objects (e.g. burred plant seeds) from body surface scratches itself and grooms other animals. Humans can have the tendency to bite each other whether they are children or adults.Bites often result in serious punctures avulsions fractures hemorrhages infections envenomation and death.  In modern human societies dog bites are the most common types with children the most common victims and faces the most common targets.  Other species that can exhibit such behavior towards human's are typically aggressive urban animals such as feral cats spiders snakes vampire bats.

More than one successive bite is often called a dog attack although dog attacks can include knock-downs and scratches. Though some dog bites do not result in injury they can result in infection disfigurement temporary or permanent disability or death. Another type of dog bite is the \"soft bite\" displayed by well-trained dogs by puppies and in non-aggressive play. Dog bites can occur during dog fighting as a response to mistreatment by trained dogs working as guard police or military animals or during a random encounter.There is debate on whether or not certain breeds of dogs are inherently more prone to commit attacks causing serious injury (i.e. so driven by instinct and breeding that under certain circumstances they are exceedingly likely to attempt or commit dangerous attacks). It is recognized that the risk of dog bites can be increased by human actions such as abuse or bite training or through inaction such as neglect carelessness in confinement or lack of control.Significant dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. It is estimated that 2% of the U.S. population  4.5\u20134.7 million people are bitten by dogs each year. Most bites occur in children with nearly half of all children in the U.S. being bitten by a dog at least once by the age of 12. In the 1980s and 1990s the U.S. averaged 17 deaths per year. Between 2011 and 2021 approximately 468 people were killed by dog bites in the United States averaging 43 deaths per year. Between 2018 and 2021 deaths were more than doubled for both males (age 15 to 37) and females (age 20 to 44).

Management involves:wound cleansing and careprophylactic antibioticspost-bite rabies treatmentpost-bite tetanus treatmentSerious infections can result after a monkey bite. Simian herpes B virus is endemic in some species of Asian monkeys. It was first identified by an investigator who was bitten by what appeared to be a healthy monkey. The investigator died shortly thereafter from brain inflammation (encephalitis). Subsequent simian-acquired infections with this virus have occurred with mortality rate as high as 80%. Currently transmission of the virus through a monkey bite almost always is the result of an occupational exposure by biomedical research workers.The progression of the infection has been described: \"[The infection presents with] herpetic skin lesions and sensory changes [are visible] near the exposure site fever and nonspecific flu-like myalgias and headaches fatigue and progressive neurologic impairment including dyspnea. Once the central nervous system is involved the outcome is invariably fatal. But with the deployment of antiviral therapy both for prophylaxis and treatment cases are now infrequent and deaths are rare although they have occurred.\"Prevention is accomplished through education and traveler's warnings. Prevention also includes the surveillance for the presence of rabies within monkey populations. Research is lacking in the assessment of the impact of monkey bites. From 1960 to 2013 159 cases of rabies infections in humans have been documented as a result of monkey bites. These numbers were gathered from records of traveler's injuries and the prevalence of monkey bites in area residents is assumed to be much higher."

For a bite to be significant substantial envenomation is required. Bites from the widow spiders involve a neurotoxic venom which produces a condition known as latrodectism. Symptoms may include pain which may be at the bite or involve the chest and abdomen sweating muscle cramps and vomiting among others. Bites from the recluse spiders cause the condition loxoscelism in which local necrosis of the surrounding skin and widespread breakdown of red blood cells may occur. Headaches vomiting and a mild fever may also occur. Other spiders that can cause significant bites include the Australian funnel-web spider and South American wandering spider.Efforts to prevent bites include clearing clutter and the use of pesticides. Most spider bites are managed with supportive care such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen) for pain and antihistamines for itchiness. Opioids may be used if the pain is severe. While an antivenom exists for black widow spider venom it is associated with anaphylaxis and therefore not commonly used in the United States. Antivenom against funnel web spider venom improves outcomes. Surgery may be required to repair the area of injured skin from some recluse bites.Spider bites may be overdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. In many reports of spider bites it is unclear if a spider bite actually occurred. Historically a number of conditions were attributed to spider bites. In the Middle Ages a condition claimed to arise from spider bites was tarantism where people danced wildly. While necrosis has been attributed to the bites of a number of spiders good evidence only supports this for recluse spiders."

They are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller \"cockers\" were used in woodcock hunting while their larger littermates were used to flush or \"spring\" other game birds. In 1902 The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term Springer comes from the historic hunting role where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air."

Although autoimmune pancreatitis is quite rare it constitutes an important clinical problem for both patients and their clinicians: the disease commonly presents itself as a tumorous mass which is diagnostically indistinguishable from pancreatic cancer a disease that is much more common in addition to being very dangerous. Hence some patients undergo pancreatic surgery which is associated to substantial  mortality and morbidity out of the fear by patients and clinicians to undertreat a malignancy. However surgery is not a good treatment for this condition as AIP responds well to immunosuppressive treatment. There are two categories of AIP: Type 1 and Type 2 each with distinct clinical profiles.Type 1 AIP is now regarded as a manifestation of IgG4-related disease and those affected have tended to be older and to have a high relapse rate. Type 1 pancreatitis is as such as manifestation of IgG4 disease which may also affect bile ducts in the liver salivary glands kidneys and lymph nodes. Type 2 AIP seems to affect only the pancreas although about one-third of people with type 2 AIP have associated inflammatory bowel disease. AIP occurring in association with an autoimmune disorder has been referred to as \"secondary\" or \"syndromic\" AIP. AIP does not affect long-term survival."

This differentiation and activation of the B cell occurs most rapidly after exposure to antigen by antigen-presenting cells in the reticuloendothelial system and under modulation by T cells and is closely intertwined with affinity maturation.  B cells that respond most avidly to antigen are preferentially allowed to proliferate and mature a process known as clonal selection.In lymphocytic neoplastic diseases such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma but also other illnesses there can be a massive expansion of a single B-cell clone detectable by measuring the excessively-produced antibodies measured in a serum protein electrophoresis test or peripheral blood flow cytometry.  Such an expansion is said to be \"monoclonal\" and monoclonal antibodies produced by such a group of B cells can cause illnesses such as amyloidosis and lupus or can be indicative of an underlying malignancy.  The concept of clonality is closely associated with malignancy for example in diagnosing lymphomatoid skin lesions.  The expansion of a particular clone of immune B cells is usually interpreted by clinicians as evidence of unrestricted cell growth the hallmark of cancer."

The soft tissue covering a partially erupted tooth is known as an operculum an area which can be difficult to access with normal oral hygiene methods. The hyponym operculitis technically refers to inflammation of the operculum alone.Pericoronitis is caused by an accumulation of bacteria and debris beneath the operculum or by mechanical trauma (e.g. biting the operculum with the opposing tooth). Pericoronitis is often associated with partially erupted and impacted mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth) often occurring at the age of wisdom tooth eruption (15-26). Other common causes of similar pain from the third molar region are food impaction causing periodontal pain pulpitis from dental caries (tooth decay) and acute myofascial pain in temporomandibular joint disorder.Pericoronitis is classified into chronic and acute. Chronic pericoronitis can present with no or only mild symptoms and long remissions between any escalations to acute pericoronitis. Acute pericoronitis is associated with a wide range of symptoms including severe pain swelling and fever.  Sometimes there is an associated pericoronal abscess (an accumulation of pus). This infection can spread to the cheeks orbits/periorbits and other parts of the face or neck and occasionally can lead to airway compromise (e.g. Ludwig's angina) requiring emergency hospital treatment. The treatment of pericoronitis is through pain management and by resolving the inflammation. The inflammation can be resolved by flushing the debris or infection from the pericoronal tissues or by removing the associated tooth or operculum. Retaining the tooth requires improved oral hygiene in the area to prevent further acute pericoronitis episodes. Tooth removal is often indicated in cases of recurrent pericoronitis. The term is from the Greek peri \"around\" Latin corona \"crown\" and -itis \"inflammation\"."

As a result it is hard to characterize a patient with this disorder. Manifestations of the disease  include but are not limited to recurrent fever livedoid rash (reticularis or racemosa) various cytopenias stroke immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure. Symptoms often onset during early childhood but some cases have been discovered as late as 65 years old.DADA2 is caused by mutations in the ADA2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  The protein product of this gene adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) is an extracellular enzyme that breaks down adenosine and may also serve as a growth factor.  Pathogenic mutations decrease this enzymatic activity in patient blood leading to disease manifestations. However mutational status and residual enzyme activity levels do not explicitly correlate with the type of disease a patient displays.The most common treatment for DADA2 is TNF inhibitors.  This therapy tends to prevent vasculitis-related manifestations such as rash and stroke but does not perform well in individuals presenting with severe hematologic and immunologic abnormalities such as bone marrow failure or severe recurrent infections. In these cases hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has led to major improvements in the vascular hematologic and immunologic manifestations of disease."

Viruses are able to initiate infection disperse throughout the body and replicate due to specific virulence factors.There are several factors that affect pathogenesis. Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.Viral pathogenesis is affected by various factors: (1) transmission entry and spread within the host (2) tropism (3) virus virulence and disease mechanisms (4) host factors and host defense."

Initial signs and symptoms of glioblastoma are nonspecific. They may include headaches personality changes nausea and symptoms similar to those of a stroke. Symptoms often worsen rapidly and may progress to unconsciousness.The cause of most cases of glioblastoma is not known. Uncommon risk factors include genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis and Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome and previous radiation therapy. Glioblastomas represent 15% of all brain tumors. They are thought to arise from astrocytes. The diagnosis typically is made by a combination of a CT scan MRI scan and tissue biopsy.There is no known method of preventing the cancer. Treatment usually involves surgery after which chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used. The medication temozolomide is frequently used as part of chemotherapy. High-dose steroids may be used to help reduce swelling and decrease symptoms. Surgical removal (decompression) of the tumor is linked to increased survival but only by some months.Despite maximum treatment the cancer almost always recurs. The typical duration of survival following diagnosis is 10\u201313 months with fewer than 5\u201310% of people surviving longer than five years. Without treatment survival is typically three months. It is the most common cancer that begins within the brain and the second-most common brain tumor after meningioma which is benign in most cases. About 3 in 100000 people develop the disease per year. The average age at diagnosis is 64 and the disease occurs more commonly in males than females.Tumors of the central nervous system are the 10th leading cause of death worldwide with up to 90% being brain tumors.

Despite countless efforts to develop new therapies for GBM over the years the median survival rate of GBM patients worldwide is a dismal 8 months with radiation and chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment beginning shortly after diagnosis only improving median survival length to around 14 months and a five-year survival rate of 5-10%. Similarly the five-year survival rate for individuals with any form of primary malignant brain tumor is only 20%. The challenges associated with successfully treating brain cancers are numerous. In the simplest terms brain tumors often occur in areas too difficult or dangerous to surgically resect and most drug therapeutics are incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quantities to stop tumor growth. Furthermore while stereotactic radiosurgery-based approaches have proved to be effective for ablating a variety of brain tumors visible to MRI and other neuroimaging metastatic brain cancers maintain high recurrence rates with GBM recurrence seemingly inevitable."

        "article": "Neurofibromatosis (NF) refers to a group of three distinct genetic conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The tumors are non-cancerous (benign) and often involve the skin or surrounding bone. Although symptoms are often mild each condition presents differently. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is typically characterized by caf\u00e9 au lait spots (light-brown flat patches of skin) neurofibromas (small bumps in or under the skin) scoliosis (side-way curvature of the back) and headaches. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) on the other hand may present with early-onset hearing loss cataracts tinnitus difficulty walking or maintain balance and muscle atrophy. The third type is called schwannomatosis and often presents in early adulthood with widespread pain numbness or tingling due to nerve compression.The cause is a genetic mutation in certain oncogenes. These can be inherited or in about half of cases spontaneously occur during early development. Different mutations result in the three types of NF. Neurofibromatosis arise from the supporting cells of the nervous system rather than the neurons themselves. In NF1 the tumors are neurofibromas (tumors of the peripheral nerves) while in NF2 and schwannomatosis tumors of Schwann cells are more common. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms examination medical imaging and biopsy. Genetic testing may rarely be done to support the diagnosis.There is no known prevention or cure. Surgery may be done to remove tumors that are causing problems or have become cancerous. Radiation and chemotherapy may also be used if cancer occurs. A cochlear implant or auditory brainstem implant may help some who have hearing loss due to the condition.In the United States about 1 in 3500 people have NF1 and 1 in 25000 have NF2. Males and females are affected equally often. In NF1 symptoms are often present at birth or develop before 10 years of age. While the condition typically worsens with time most people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy. In NF2 symptoms may not become apparent until early adulthood. NF2 increases the risk of early death. Descriptions of the condition occur as far back as the 1st century. It was formally described by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882 after whom it was previously named."

        "article": "Neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1) or von Recklinghausen syndrome is a complex multi-system human disorder caused by the mutation of neurofibromin 1 (NF-1) a gene on chromosome 17 that is responsible for production of a protein (neurofibromin) which is needed for normal function in many human cell types. NF-1 causes tumors along the nervous system which can grow anywhere on the body. NF-1 is one of the most common genetic disorders and is not limited to any person's race or sex. NF-1 is an autosomal dominant disorder which means that mutation or deletion of one copy (or allele) of the NF-1 gene is sufficient for the development of NF-1 although presentation varies widely and is often different even between relatives affected by NF-1.As of 2015 there are at least 100000 people in the U.S. and about 25000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with NF. Common symptoms of NF-1 include brownish-red spots in the colored part of the eye called Lisch nodules benign skin tumors called neurofibromas and larger benign tumors of nerves called plexiform neurofibromas scoliosis (curvature of the spine) learning disabilities vision disorders mental disabilities multiple caf\u00e9 au lait spots and epilepsy. While some people have major complications others with the condition can lead productive and full lives.NF-1 is a developmental syndrome caused by germline mutations in neurofibromin a gene that is involved in the RAS pathway (RASopathy). Due to its rarity and to the fact that genetic diagnosis has been used only in recent years in the past NF-1 was in some cases confused with Legius syndrome another syndrome with vaguely similar symptoms including cafe-au-lait spots.NF-1 is an age-specific disease; most signs of NF-1 are visible after birth (during infancy) but many symptoms of NF-1 occur as the person ages and has hormonal changes. NF-1 was formerly known as von Recklinghausen disease after the researcher who first documented the disorder Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen.The severity of NF-1 varies widely and little is known about what causes a person to have more severe or less severe symptoms. Even within the same family (as there is a 50% chance that a parent will pass their condition to their offspring) levels of severity can vary enormously. However 60% of people with NF-1 have mild cases with few symptoms that have very little effect in their day-to-day lives. About 20% of NF-1 patients have moderate cases with several symptoms that have little more than cosmetic effects. The other 20% have severe cases with several symptoms that affect the person's quality of life. Even in this last group symptoms are rarely life-threatening."

The types of tumors frequently associated with NF2 include vestibular schwannomas meningiomas and ependymomas. The main manifestation of the condition is the development of bilateral benign brain tumors in the nerve sheath of the cranial nerve VIII which is the \"auditory-vestibular nerve\" that transmits sensory information from the inner ear to the brain. Besides other benign brain and spinal tumors occur. Symptoms depend on the presence localisation and growth of the tumor(s). Many people with this condition also experience vision problems. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2 or NF II) is caused by mutations of the \"Merlin\" gene which seems to influence the form and movement of cells. The principal treatments consist of neurosurgical removal of the tumors and surgical treatment of the eye lesions. Historically the underlying disorder has not had any therapy due to the cell function caused by the genetic mutation."

Originally described in Japanese patients it consists of multiple cutaneous schwannomas central nervous system tumors and other neurological complications excluding hallmark signs of NF. The exact frequency of schwannomatosis cases is unknown although some populations have noted frequencies as few as 1 case per 1.7 million people.Schwannomas are mostly benign tumors that commonly occur in individuals with NF2 and schwannomatosis (sometimes called neurofibromatosis type III). Schwann cells are glial cells that myelinate the axons of nerve cells. Myelin is a lipid covering that speeds the conduction of action potentials. When Schwann cells proliferate out of control in an encapsulation it is called a schwannoma. Although schwannomas are benign they become detrimental when the growing tumor compresses the nerve. Schwannomas on sensory nerve axons cause chronic severe pain. Treatment options for schwannomas are to surgically remove them have radiation cyberknife or intracapsular enucleation. Previous designations for schwannomas include neurinoma and neurilemmoma."

        "article": "A vestibular schwannoma (VS) also called acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibulocochlear nerve that passes from the inner ear to the brain. The tumor originates when Schwann cells that form the insulating myelin sheath on the nerve malfunction. Normally Schwann cells function beneficially to protect the nerves which transmit balance and sound information to the brain. However sometimes a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene NF2 located on chromosome 22 results in abnormal production of the cell protein named Merlin and Schwann cells multiply to form a tumor. The tumor originates mostly on the vestibular division of the nerve rather than the cochlear division but hearing as well as balance will be affected  as the tumor enlarges.The great majority of these VSs (95%) are unilateral in one ear only. They are called \"sporadic\" (i.e. by-chance non-hereditary). Although non-cancerous they can do harm or even become life-threatening if they grow to press on other cranial nerves and vital structures such as the brainstem. Variations in the mutation determine the nature of the tumor's development. The only environmental exposure that has been definitely associated with the growth of a VS is therapeutic radiation exposure to the head."

Acute pancreatitis may be a single event; it may be recurrent; or it may progress to chronic pancreatitis and/or pancreatic failure (the term pancreatic dysfunction includes cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis where the pancreas is measurably damaged even if it has not failed).Mild cases are usually successfully treated with conservative measures: hospitalization pain control nothing by mouth intravenous (IV) nutritional support and intravenous fluid rehydration. Severe cases often require admission to an intensive care unit to monitor and manage complications of the disease. Complications are associated with a high mortality even with optimal management. For people with this condition the pancreas will begin to secrete active enzymes such as trypsin chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase instead of their inactive forms.

Acute cases are typically due to bacterial infection and chronic cases are often due to allergies and autoimmune disorders. The most common cause of otitis externa is bacterial. Risk factors for acute cases include swimming minor trauma from cleaning using hearing aids and ear plugs and other skin problems such as psoriasis and dermatitis. People with diabetes are at risk of a severe form of malignant otitis externa. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. Culturing the ear canal may be useful in chronic or severe cases.Acetic acid ear drops may be used as a preventive measure. Treatment of acute cases is typically with antibiotic drops such as ofloxacin or acetic acid. Steroid drops may be used in addition to antibiotics. Pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used for the pain. Antibiotics by mouth are not recommended unless the person has poor immune function or there is infection of the skin around the ear. Typically improvement occurs within a day of the start of treatment. Treatment of chronic cases depends on the cause.Otitis externa affects 1\u20133% of people a year; more than 95% of cases are acute. About 10% of people are affected at some point in their lives. It occurs most commonly among children between the ages of seven and twelve and among the elderly. It occurs with near equal frequency in males and females.

As part of defining and describing terms the body is described through the use of anatomical planes and anatomical axes.The meaning of terms that are used can change depending on whether an organism is bipedal or quadrupedal. Additionally for some animals such as invertebrates some terms may not have any meaning at all; for example an animal that is radially symmetrical will have no anterior surface but can still have a description that a part is close to the middle (\"proximal\") or further from the middle (\"distal\").International organisations have determined vocabularies that are often used as standards for subdisciplines of anatomy. For example Terminologia Anatomica for humans and Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria for animals.

        "article": "The single-bullet theory also known as the magic-bullet theory was introduced by the Warren Commission in its investigation of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to explain what happened to the bullet that struck Kennedy in the back and exited through his throat. Given the lack of damage to the presidential limousine consistent with it having been struck by a high-velocity bullet and the fact that Texas Governor John Connally was wounded and was seated on a jumper seat 1+1\u20442 feet (0.5 meters) in front of and slightly to the left of the president the Commission concluded they were likely struck by the same bullet.Generally credited to Warren Commission staffer Arlen Specter (later a United States Senator from Pennsylvania) this theory posits that a single bullet known as \"Warren Commission Exhibit 399\" or \"CE 399\" caused all the wounds to the governor and the non-fatal wounds to the president which totals up to seven entry/exit wounds in both men.The theory says that a three-centimeter-long (1.2\") copper-jacketed lead-core bullet from a 6.5\u00d752mm Mannlicher\u2013Carcano rifle fired from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository passed through President Kennedy's neck into Governor Connally's chest went through his right wrist and embedded itself in Connally's left thigh. If so this bullet traversed a back brace 15 layers of clothing seven layers of skin and approximately 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) of muscle tissue and pulverized 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) of Connally's rib and shattered his radius bone. The bullet was found on a gurney in the corridor at Parkland Memorial Hospital after the assassination. The Warren Commission found that this gurney was the one that had carried Governor Connally.In its final conclusion the Warren Commission found \"persuasive evidence from the experts\" that a single bullet caused President Kennedy's throat wound and all of the wounds found in Governor Connally. It acknowledged that there was a \"difference of opinion\" among members of the Commission \"as to this probability\" but stated that the theory was not essential to its conclusions and that all members had no doubt that all shots were fired from the sixth-floor window of the Depository building.Most critics believe that the single-bullet theory is essential to the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The reason for this is timing: if as the Warren Commission found President Kennedy was wounded some time between frames 210 and 225 of the Zapruder film and Governor Connally was wounded in the back/chest no later than frame 240 there would not have been enough time between the wounding of the two men for Oswald to have fired two shots from his bolt-action rifle. FBI marksmen who test-fired the rifle for the Warren Commission concluded that the \"minimum time for getting off two successive well-aimed shots on the rifle is approximately 2 and a quarter seconds\" or 41 to 42 Zapruder frames.The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations published their report in 1979 stating that their \"forensic pathology panel's conclusions were consistent with the so-called single bullet theory advanced by the Warren Commission\"."

These rays are also known as Bucky rays.Grenz rays are produced by specially calibrated X-ray machines generally operating in the 10 to 30\u00a0kV range to produce X-rays with HVL less than 0.035\u00a0mm in aluminum. (HVL is half-value layer and refers to a thickness of a given material that will cut the X-ray flux by 50%). Grenz rays are absorbed by air and therefore treatments must be given at fixed distances for which the machine has been calibrated.  In human tissue Grenz rays have a half-value depth of 0.5\u00a0mm and are essentially absorbed within the first 2\u00a0mm of skin.

        "article": "Cryoglobulinemia is a medical condition in which the blood contains large amounts of pathological cold sensitive antibodies called  cryoglobulins \u2013 proteins (mostly immunoglobulins themselves) that become insoluble at reduced temperatures. This should be contrasted with cold agglutinins which cause agglutination of red blood cells.Cryoglobulins typically precipitate (clumps together) at temperatures below normal body temperature\u00a0\u2013 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0\u2013 and will dissolve again if the blood is heated. The precipitated clump can block blood vessels and cause toes and fingers to become gangrenous. While this disease is commonly referred to as cryoglobulinemia in the medical literature it is better termed cryoglobulinemic disease for two reasons: 1) cryoglobulinemia is also used to indicate the circulation of (usually low levels of) cryoglobulins in the absence of any symptoms or disease and 2) healthy individuals can develop transient asymptomatic cryoglobulinemia following certain infections.In contrast to these benign instances of circulating cryoglobulins cryoglobulinemic disease involves the signs and symptoms of precipitating cryoglobulins and is commonly associated with various pre-malignant malignant infectious or autoimmune diseases that are the underlying cause for production of the cryoglobulins."

Onset of symptoms is less than two weeks following exposure. Complications may include liver failure. Survivors generally recover around two weeks after onset.The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or close contact with the blood secretions organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons or animals. Groups that are at high risk of infection are farmers and those who work in slaughterhouses. The virus can also spread between people via body fluids. Diagnosis can be made by detecting antibodies the virus's RNA or viral proteins (antigens). It is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever.There are no FDA- or WHO-approved therapeutics for CCHF and a vaccine is not commercially available. Prevention involves avoiding tick bites following safe practices in meat processing plants and observing universal healthcare precautions. Treatment is typically with supportive care and the medication ribavirin may also help.CCHF cases are observed in a wide geographic range including Africa Russia the Balkans the Middle East and Asia. Typically small outbreaks are seen in areas where the virus is endemic. In 2013 Iran Russia Turkey and Uzbekistan documented more than 50 cases. The fatality rate is typically between 10 and 40% though fatalities as high as 80% have been observed in some outbreaks. The virus was first observed in Crimea in the 1940s and was later identified as the same agent of what had been called Congo Hemorrhagic Fever.In the past 20 years CCHF outbreaks have been reported in eastern Europe particularly in the former Soviet Union throughout the Mediterranean in northwestern China central Asia southern Europe Africa the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. CCHF is on WHO's priority list for Research and Development and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID) priority A list as a disease posing the highest level of risk to national security and public health."

        "article": "Ebola also known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. Symptoms typically start anywhere between two days and three weeks after infection. The first symptoms are usually fever sore throat muscle pain and headaches. These are usually followed by vomiting diarrhoea rash and decreased liver and kidney function at which point some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. It kills between 25% and 90% of those infected \u2013 about 50% on average. Death is often due to shock from fluid loss and typically occurs between six and 16 days after the first symptoms appear. Early treatment of symptoms increases the survival rate considerably compared to late start. An Ebola vaccine was approved by the US FDA in December 2019.The virus spreads through direct contact with body fluids such as blood from infected humans or other animals or from contact with items that have recently been contaminated with infected body fluids. There have been no documented cases either in nature or under laboratory conditions of spread through the air between humans or other primates. After recovering from Ebola semen or breast milk may continue to carry the virus for anywhere between several weeks to several months. Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature; they are able to spread the virus without being affected by it. The symptoms of Ebola may resemble those of several other diseases including malaria cholera typhoid fever meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Diagnosis is confirmed by testing blood samples for the presence of viral RNA viral antibodies or the virus itself.Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement including rapid detection contact tracing of those exposed quick access to laboratory services care for those infected and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Prevention measures involve wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when in close proximity to patients and while handling potentially infected bushmeat as well as thoroughly cooking bushmeat. An Ebola vaccine was approved by the US FDA in December 2019. While there is no approved treatment for Ebola as of 2019 two treatments (atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab and ansuvimab) are associated with improved outcomes. Supportive efforts also improve outcomes. These include oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids and treating symptoms. In October 2020 atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab (Inmazeb) was approved for medical use in the United States to treat the disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus."

        "article": "Methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol Medrol Solu-Medrol) is a synthetic glucocorticoid primarily prescribed for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. It is either used at low doses for chronic illnesses or used concomitantly at high doses during acute flares. Methylprednisolone and its derivatives can be administered orally or parenterally.Regardless of route of administration methylprednisolone integrates systemically as exhibited by its effectiveness to quickly reduce inflammation during acute flares. It is associated with many adverse reactions that require tapering off the drug as soon as the disease is under control. Serious side effects include iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome hypertension osteoporosis diabetes infection and skin atrophy.Chemically methylprednisolone is a synthetic pregnane steroid hormone derived from hydrocortisone and prednisolone. It belongs to a class of synthetic glucocorticoids and more generally corticosteroids. It acts as a mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor agonist. In comparison to other exogenous glucocorticoids methylprednisolone has a higher affinity to glucocorticoid receptors than to mineralocorticoid receptors.Glucocorticoid's name was derived after the discovery of their involvement in regulating carbohydrate metabolism. The cellular functions of glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone are now understood to regulate homeostasis metabolism development cognition and inflammation. They play a critical role in adapting and responding to environmental physical and emotional stress.Methylprednisolone was first synthesized and manufactured by The Upjohn Company (now Pfizer) and FDA approved in the United States in October 1957. In 2021 it was the 168th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 3\u00a0million prescriptions. Methylprednisolone is also on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines for its effects against lymphoid leukemia."

        "article": "Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii an apicomplexan. Infections with toxoplasmosis are associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric and behavioral conditions. Occasionally people may have a few weeks or months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If a woman becomes infected during pregnancy a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.Toxoplasmosis is usually spread by eating poorly cooked food that contains cysts by exposure to infected cat feces or from an infected woman to her baby during pregnancy. Rarely the disease may be spread by blood transfusion or other organ transplant. It is not otherwise spread between people. The parasite is known to reproduce sexually only in the cat family. However it can infect most types of warm-blooded animals including humans. Diagnosis is typically by testing blood for antibodies or by testing the amniotic fluid in a pregnant patient for the parasite's DNA.Prevention is by properly preparing and cooking food. Pregnant women are also recommended not to clean cat litter boxes or if they must to wear gloves and wash their hands afterwards. Treatment of otherwise healthy people is usually not needed. During pregnancy spiramycin or pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine and folinic acid may be used for treatment.Up to half of the world's population is infected by T.\u00a0gondii but have no symptoms. In the United States approximately 11% of people have been infected while in some areas of the world this is more than 60%. Approximately 200000 cases of congenital toxoplasmosis occur a year. Charles Nicolle and Louis Manceaux first described the organism in 1908. In 1941 transmission during pregnancy from a pregnant woman to her baby was confirmed. There is tentative evidence that otherwise asymptomatic infection may affect people's behavior."

Causes of atrophy include mutations (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ) poor nourishment poor circulation loss of hormonal support loss of nerve supply to the target organ excessive amount of apoptosis of cells and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have trophic effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as atrophy. Atrophy is reduction in size of cell organ or tissue after attaining its normal mature growth. In contrast hypoplasia is the reduction in the cellular numbers of an organ or tissue that has not attained normal maturity.Atrophy is the general physiological process of reabsorption and breakdown of tissues involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support because of other diseases it is termed pathological atrophy although it can be a part of normal body development and homeostasis as well."

        "article": "Chronic radiation syndrome (CRS) or chronic radiation enteritis is a constellation of health effects of radiation that occur after months or years of chronic exposure to high amounts of radiation. Chronic radiation syndrome develops with a speed and severity proportional to the radiation dose received (i.e. it is a deterministic effect of exposure to ionizing radiation) unlike radiation-induced cancer. It is distinct from acute radiation syndrome in that it occurs at dose rates low enough to permit natural repair mechanisms to compete with the radiation damage during the exposure period. Dose rates high enough to cause the acute form (&gt; ~0.1 Gy/h) are fatal long before onset of the chronic form. The lower threshold for chronic radiation syndrome is between 0.7 and 1.5 Gy at dose rates above 0.1 Gy/yr. This condition is primarily known from the Kyshtym disaster where 66 cases were diagnosed. It has received little mention in Western literature; but see the ICRP\u2019s 2012 Statement.In 2013 Alexander V. Akleyev described the chronology of the clinical course of CRS while presenting at ConRad in Munich Germany. In his presentation he defined the latent period as being 1\u20135 years and the formation coinciding with the period of maximum radiation dose. The recovery period was described as being 3\u201312 months after exposure ceased. He concluded that \"CRS represents a systemic response of the body as a whole to the chronic total body exposure in man.\" In 2014 Akleyev's book \"Comprehensive analysis of chronic radiation syndrome covering epidemiology pathogenesis pathoanatomy diagnosis and treatment\" was published by Springer.Symptoms of chronic radiation syndrome would include at an early stage impaired sense of touch and smell and disturbances of the vegetative functions. At a later stage muscle and skin atrophy and eye cataract follow with possible fibrous formations on the skin in case of previous radiation burns. Solid cancer or leukemia due to genetic damage may appear at any time."

Raised in Stockton California by working-class parents Leigh was discovered at 18 by actress Norma Shearer who helped her secure a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Leigh appeared in radio programs before her first formal foray into acting making her film debut in the drama The Romance of Rosy Ridge (1947). With MGM she appeared in many films which spanned a wide variety of genres which include the crime-drama Act of Violence (1948) the drama Little Women (1949) the comedy Angels in the Outfield (1951) the romance Scaramouche (1952) and the western drama The Naked Spur (1953). She played dramatic roles during the late 1950s in such films as Safari (1956) and Orson Welles's film noir Touch of Evil (1958). With RKO Radio Pictures she co-starred in the romantic comedy Holiday Affair (1949) with Robert Mitchum.Leigh achieved her biggest success starring as Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's horror film Psycho (1960).For her performance Leigh won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Intermittently she continued to appear in films including Bye Bye Birdie (1963) Harper (1966) Night of the Lepus (1972) and Boardwalk (1979). She made her Broadway debut in 1975 in a production of Murder Among Friends. She would also go on to appear in two horror films with her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis: The Fog (1980) and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998).In addition to her work as an actress Leigh also wrote four books between 1984 and 2002 two of which were novels. Leigh had two brief marriages as a teenager (one of which was annulled) before marrying actor Tony Curtis in 1951. The pair's highly publicized union ended in divorce in 1962 and after starring in The Manchurian Candidate that same year Leigh remarried and scaled back her career. She died in 2004 at age 77 following a year-long battle with vasculitis."

As a surgical measure it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb such as malignancy or gangrene. In some cases it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation a congenital disorder where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries judicial amputation is currently used to punish people who commit crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. When done by a person the person executing the amputation is an amputator. The oldest evidence of this practice comes from a skeleton found buried in Liang Tebo cave East Kalimantan Indonesian Borneo dating back to at least 31000 years ago where it was done when the amputee was a young child."

The pain shows the highest intensity during the third to the seventh day postpartum and becomes most severe on the third day postpartum.Nipple pain can result from many conditions. Early nipple pain in breastfeeding is usually caused by improper positioning and latch while breastfeeding. Other causes may include blocked milk ducts tongue-tie cracked nipples and nipple infections by yeasts bacteria or viruses. Complications in nursing women involve an increase in nipple sensitivity or breast engorgement leading to mastitis and subsequent pain. Common diagnostic approaches include quantifying pain by the numerical rating scale (NRS) and maternal breast or infant mouth examinations.Nipple pain may hinder breastfeeding and is the most common reason for early weaning. General management such as positioning and latch adjustment and thermal intervention can be administered for pain alleviation. Appropriate treatment of nipple pain is given based on the underlying cause."

It was recorded in early 1985 at Weryton Studios Munich following a turbulent period: co-founder lead guitarist and co-principal songwriter Mick Jones and drummer Topper Headon had been dismissed by lead vocalist Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon. Jones and Headon were replaced  by three unknowns: guitarists Vince White and Nick Sheppard and drummer Pete Howard. During the tense recording sessions Clash manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer fought each other for control over the band's songwriting and musical direction.Strummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production Rhodes took charge of the arrangements track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for synthetic drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of sampling were widely derided. One writer described the album's sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\". Rhodes chose the album title taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2.  The recording process and tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States and planned an expensive video for a lead single. On release Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\". Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release. He performed only one song from the album live during his solo career and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets. Although it is still generally regarded as the band's worst album contemporary critics have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance especially on the tracks \"This Is England\" \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\"."

It was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on October 10 2007. In the episode Randy Marsh produces what is apparently \"the biggest crap\" ever taken but his claims for the world record are challenged.\"More Crap\" is highly scatological in tone with its plot and humor revolving around feces as a topic. It is one of the few episodes of South Park in which neither Cartman Kyle nor Kenny appear. The episode satirizes U2 vocalist Bono who is portrayed as strongly arrogant and competitive due to harboring an embarrassing secret. The plot of \"More Crap\" satirizes the competitive nature of aiming to achieve a record in a peculiar category and parodies elements of the 2007 documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters.The episode aired shortly after South Park received an Emmy Award that year for the episode \"Make Love Not Warcraft\". A running gag in \"More Crap\" makes reference to the series's Emmy-wins during especially scatological scenes."

He improved the S-bend plumbing trap in 1880 by inventing the U-bend. The firm's lavatorial equipment was manufactured at premises in nearby Marlborough Road (now Draycott Avenue). The company owned the world's first bath toilet and sink showroom in King's Road. Crapper was noted for the quality of his products and received several royal warrants.Manhole covers with Crapper's company's name on them in Westminster Abbey have become one of London's minor tourist attractions."

A  variation is heat-resistant foil tape useful for sealing heating and cooling ducts produced because the adhesive on standard duct tape fails and the synthetic fabric reinforcement mesh deteriorates when used on heating ducts. Duct tape is generally silvery gray in color but also available in other colors and printed designs from whimsical yellow ducks college logos to practical camouflage patterns. It is often confused with gaffer tape (which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed unlike duct tape).During World War II Revolite (then a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson) developed an adhesive tape made from a rubber-based adhesive  applied to a durable duck cloth backing. This tape resisted water and was used to seal some ammunition cases during that period.\"Duck tape\" is recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary as having been in use since 1899 and \"duct tape\" (described as \"perhaps an alteration of earlier duck tape\") since 1965."

The tape might create a macerating and keratolytic environment stimulating an immune response. The type of adhesive in the duct tape is likely to be important as leeching of the adhesive into the skin may be causing the immune system response. Side effects can include skin irritation and peeling.There is mixed evidence that occlusive treatment with various types of duct tape is effective. Clinical trials in 2012 concluded that no statistically significant difference between clear duct tape and placebo could be determined within the sample. On health information websites duct tape is referred to as a treatment with mixed evidence of efficacy no good evidence or described as alternative medicine.Despite the mixed evidence for efficacy the simplicity of the method and its limited side-effects leads some researchers to be reluctant to dismiss it."

It may present in the fetus infant or later. Clinical features vary and differ between early onset that is presentation before 2-years of age and late onset presentation after age 2-years. Infection in the unborn baby may present as poor growth non-immune hydrops leading to premature birth or loss of the baby or no signs. Affected newborns mostly initially have no clinical signs. They may be small and irritable. Characteristic features include a rash fever large liver and spleen a runny and congested nose and inflammation around bone or cartilage. There may be jaundice large glands pneumonia meningitis warty bumps on genitals deafness or blindness. Untreated babies that survive the early phase may develop skeletal deformities including deformity of the nose lower legs forehead collar bone jaw and cheek bone. There may be a perforated or high arched palate and recurrent joint disease. Other late signs include linear perioral tears intellectual disability hydrocephalus and juvenile general paresis. Seizures and cranial nerve palsies may first occur in both early and late phases. Eighth nerve palsy interstitial keratitis and small notched teeth may appear individually or together; known as Hutchinson's triad.It is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum when it infects the baby after crossing the placenta or from contact with a syphilitic sore at birth. It is not transmitted during breastfeeding unless there is an open sore on the mother's breast. The unborn baby can become infected at any time during the pregnancy. Most cases occur due to inadequate antenatal screening and treatment during pregnancy. The baby is highly infectious if the rash and snuffles are present. The disease may be suspected from tests on the mother; blood tests and ultrasound. Tests on the baby may include blood tests CSF analysis and medical imaging. Findings may reveal anemia and low platelets. Other findings may include low sugars proteinuria and hypopituitarism. The placenta may appear large and pale. Other investigations include testing for HIV. Prevention is by safe sex to prevent syphilis in the mother and early screening and treatment of syphilis in pregnancy. One intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G administered to a pregnant woman early in the illness can prevent congenital syphilis in her baby. Treatment of suspected congenital syphilis is with penicillin by injection; benzylpenicillin into vein or procaine benzylpenicillin into muscle. During times of penicillin unavailability ceftriaxone may be an alternative. Where there is penicillin allergy antimicrobial desensitisation is an option.Syphilis affects around one million pregnancies a year. In 2016 there were around 473 cases of congenital syphilis per 100000 live births and 204000 deaths from the disease worldwide. Of the 660000 congenital syphilis cases reported in 2016 143000 resulted in deaths of unborn babies 61000 deaths of newborn babies 41000 low birth weights or preterm births and 109000 young children diagnosed with congenital syphilis. Around 75% were from the WHO's African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Serological tests for syphilis were introduced in 1906 and it was later shown that transmission occurred from the mother."

        "article": "The Guatemala syphilis experiments were United States-led human experiments conducted in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. The experiments were led by physician John Charles Cutler who also participated in the late stages of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Doctors infected 1300 people including at least 600 soldiers and people from various impoverished groups (including but not limited to sex workers orphans inmates of mental hospitals and prisoners) with syphilis gonorrhea and chancroid without the informed consent of the subjects. Only 700 of them received treatment. In total 5500 people were involved in all research experiments of whom 83 died by the end of 1953 though it is unknown whether or not the injections were responsible for all these deaths. Serology studies continued through 1953 involving the same vulnerable populations in addition to children from state-run schools an orphanage and rural towns. However the intentional infection of patients ended with the original study.On October 1 2010 the U.S. President Secretary of State and Secretary of Health and Human Services formally apologized to Guatemala for the ethical violations. Guatemala condemned the experiment as a crime against humanity. Multiple unsuccessful lawsuits have since been filed in the US.Professor Susan Mokotoff Reverby of Wellesley College uncovered information about these experiments in Cutler's archived papers in 2005 while researching the Tuskegee syphilis study. She shared her findings with United States government officials. Francis Collins the NIH director at the time of the revelations called the experiments \"a dark chapter in history of medicine\" and commented that modern rules prohibit conducting human subject research without informed consent."

Because it was spread geographically by French troops returning from that campaign the disease was known as \"French disease\" and it was not until 1530 that the term \"syphilis\" was first applied by the Italian physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro. The causative organism Treponema pallidum was first identified by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann in 1905 at the Charit\u00e9 Clinic in Berlin. The first effective treatment Salvarsan was developed in 1910 by Sahachiro Hata in the laboratory of Paul Ehrlich. It was followed by the introduction of penicillin in 1943.Many well-known figures including Scott Joplin Franz Schubert Friedrich Nietzsche Al Capone and \u00c9douard Manet are believed to have contracted the disease."

        "article": "Neurosyphilis is the infection of the central nervous system in a patient with syphilis. In the era of modern antibiotics the majority of neurosyphilis cases have been reported in HIV-infected patients. Meningitis is the most common neurological presentation in early syphilis. Tertiary syphilis symptoms are exclusively neurosyphilis though neurosyphilis may occur at any stage of infection.To diagnose neurosyphilis patients undergo a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. The CSF is tested for antibodies for specific Treponema pallidum antigens. The preferred test is the VDRL test which is sometimes supplemented by fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS).Historically the disease was studied under the Tuskegee study often cited as an example of unethical human experimentation. The study was done on approximately 400 African-American men with untreated syphilis who were followed from 1932 to 1972 and compared to approximately 200 men without syphilis. The study began without informed consent of the subjects and was continued by the United States Public Health Service until 1972. The researchers failed to notify and withheld treatment for patients despite knowing penicillin was found as an effective cure for neurosyphilis. After four years of follow up neurosyphilis was identified in 26.1% of patients vs. 2.5% of controls. After 20 years of followup 14% showed signs of neurosyphilis and 40% had died from other causes."

        "article": "A sexually transmitted infection (STI) also referred to as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and the older term venereal disease (VD) is an infection that is spread by sexual activity especially vaginal intercourse anal sex oral sex or sometimes manual sex.  STIs often do not initially cause symptoms which results in a risk of passing the infection on to others. Symptoms and signs of STIs may include vaginal discharge penile discharge ulcers on or around the genitals and pelvic pain. Some STIs can cause infertility.Bacterial STIs include chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis. Viral STIs include genital herpes HIV/AIDS and genital warts. Parasitic STIs include trichomoniasis. STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world but they are often unavailable in the developing world.Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safe sex practices such as use of condoms having a smaller number of sexual partners and being in a relationship in which each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk of STIs. Comprehensive sex education may also be useful. Most STIs are treatable and curable; of the most common infections syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia and trichomoniasis are curable while HIV/AIDS and genital herpes are not curable.In 2015 about 1.1\u00a0billion people had STIs other than HIV/AIDS. About 500 million were infected with either syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia or trichomoniasis. At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290\u00a0million women have human papillomavirus. STIs other than HIV resulted in 108000 deaths in 2015. In the United States there were 19 million new cases of STIs in 2010. Historical documentation of STIs in antiquity dates back to at least the Ebers Papyrus (c.\u20091550 BCE) and the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (8th/7th centuries BCE).There is often shame and stigma associated with STIs. The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease."

The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated though by the end of the study medical advancements meant it was entirely treatable. The men were not informed of the nature of the experiment and more than 100 died as a result.The Public Health Service started the study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University (then the Tuskegee Institute) a historically Black college in Alabama. In the study investigators enrolled a total of 600 impoverished African-American sharecroppers from Macon County Alabama. Of these men 399 had latent syphilis with a control group of 201 men who were not infected. As an incentive for participation in the study the men were promised free medical care. While the men were provided with both medical and mental care that they otherwise would not have received they were deceived by the PHS who never informed them of their syphilis diagnosis and provided disguised placebos ineffective methods and diagnostic procedures as treatment for \"bad blood\".The men were initially told that the experiment was only going to last six months but it was extended to 40 years. After funding for treatment was lost the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the infected men were treated with penicillin despite the fact that by 1947 the antibiotic was widely available and had become the standard treatment for syphilis.The study continued under numerous Public Health Service supervisors until 1972 when a leak to the press resulted in its termination on November 16 of that year.  By then 28 patients had died directly from syphilis 100 died from complications related to syphilis 40 of the patients' wives were infected with syphilis and 19 children were born with congenital syphilis.The 40-year Tuskegee Study was a major violation of ethical standards and has been cited as \"arguably the most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history.\" Its revelation led to the 1979 Belmont Report and to the establishment of the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and federal laws and regulations requiring institutional review boards for the protection of human subjects in studies. The OHRP manages this responsibility within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its revelation has also been an important cause of distrust in medical science and the US government amongst African Americans.On May 16 1997 President Bill Clinton formally apologized on behalf of the United States to victims of the study calling it shameful and racist. \"What was done cannot be undone but we can end the silence\" he said. \"We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people what the United States government did was shameful and I am sorry.\""

Described by Dr. Geoffrey Tweedale as a \"social disaster\" it involved the contamination with asbestos dust of an area consisting of around 1000 houses in the Armley Lodge area of the city.The contamination was the result of the activities of a local asbestos factory part of the Turner &amp; Newall (T&amp;N) group (often referred to by the name of its founders J. W. Roberts Ltd.) and occurred between the end of the 19th century and 1959 when the factory eventually closed. At its peak the factory had 250 employees. At least 300 former employees are believed to have died from asbestos-related illnesses and a number of cancer deaths in the Armley area were traced to the factory in 1988 as a result of an investigation by the Yorkshire Evening Post. The estate was found to have the highest incidence in the country of mesothelioma. As the interval between exposure and diagnosis can be up to 50 years the number of further deaths which may occur due to the factory's emissions or residual dust since its closure cannot be predicted."

        "article": "Brad Willis is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 31 October 1989. The character was initially played by Benjamin Mitchell before Scott Michaelson took over the role two years later. Brad was re-introduced alongside his sister Gaby (Rachel Blakely) during a period of roller coaster ratings for the show. Michaelson revealed that as soon as he learnt he had won the role of Brad he went surfing five days in a row as he knew he was going to be busy over the upcoming months. Michaelson signed a new twelve-month contract with Neighbours in October 1992 and a year later he announced he would be leaving the soap. Michaelson filmed his final scenes in November and departed on 15 December 1993.Before the character returned to Neighbours he was said to be living in America after gaining a basketball scholarship. The scriptwriters had wanted Brad to become a professional player but after Michaelson told them he was a surfer Brad became a \"surf bum\" instead. Brad was described as being a \"friend to all\" and a \"nice lovable fool\". He had a caring attitude and a love for family. The character's storylines often revolved around his relationships. He dated his neighbour Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and then fell in love with Beth Brennan (Natalie Imbruglia). The couple became engaged but Beth learned Brad was having an affair with Lauren Carpenter (Sarah Vandenbergh) on their wedding day. After dating different people for a while Brad and Beth got back together and married.In August 1992 Brad was shot after trying to save his mother from a hostage situation involving Bob Landers (Bruce Kilpatrick). Michaelson stated that Brad's actions might not have been sensible but he acted instinctively and the actor thought that others would have reacted the same way. A writer from BBC Online named the storyline as Brad's most notable moment throughout his duration on the show. A reporter for the Herald Sun called Brad \"one of the show's most popular characters\" and commented that Michaelson had a huge following because of his good looks. For his portrayal of Brad Michaelson earned a nomination for Most Popular Actor at the 1993 Logie Awards. He also received a nomination for Hottest Man in Soap at the Inside Soap TV Awards while Brad was nominated for Best Male Character.The character was reintroduced in early 2013 with Kip Gamblin taking over the role coinciding with Lauren's (now Kate Kendall) return. Brad displayed a more mature attitude but still retained his relaxed outlook. He returned with his second wife Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou) and their twins Josh (Harley Bonner) and Imogen (Ariel Kaplan). His other three children Paige (Olympia Valance) Piper (Mavournee Hazel) and Ned (Ben Hall) were later introduced. Brad marries Lauren in December 2016 before both characters depart on 7 April 2017."

        "article": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a species of Gram-positive aerotolerant bacteria in the genus Streptococcus.  These bacteria are extracellular and made up of non-motile and non-sporing cocci (round cells) that tend to link in chains. They are clinically important for humans as they are an infrequent but usually pathogenic part of the skin microbiota that can cause Group A streptococcal infection.  S. pyogenes  is the predominant species harboring the Lancefield group A antigen and is often called group A Streptococcus (GAS).  However both Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the Streptococcus anginosus group can possess group A antigen as well.  Group A streptococci when grown on blood agar typically produce small (2\u20133\u00a0mm) zones of beta-hemolysis a complete destruction of red blood cells. The name group A (beta-hemolytic) Streptococcus is thus also used.The species name is derived from Greek words meaning 'a chain' (streptos) of berries (coccus [Latinized from kokkos]) and pus (pyo)-forming (genes) since a number of infections caused by the bacterium produce pus.  The main criterion for differentiation between Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. is the catalase test.  Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas streptococci are catalase-negative.  S. pyogenes can be cultured on fresh blood agar plates. The PYR test allows for the differentiation of Streptococcus pyogenes from other morphologically similar beta-hemolytic streptococci (including S. dysgalactiae subsp. esquismilis) as S. pyogenes will produce a positive test result.An estimated 700 million GAS infections occur worldwide each year. While the overall mortality rate for these infections is less than 0.1% over 650000 of the cases are severe and invasive and these cases have a mortality rate of 25%. Early recognition and treatment are critical; diagnostic failure can result in sepsis and death. S. pyogenes is clinically and historically significant as the cause of scarlet fever which results from exposure to the species' exotoxin."

It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection gonorrhea as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia septic arthritis and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.It is oxidase positive and aerobic and it survives phagocytosis and grows inside neutrophils. Culturing it requires carbon dioxide supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (Thayer\u2013Martin). It exhibits antigenic variation through genetic recombination of its pili and surface proteins that interact with the immune system.Sexual transmission is through vaginal anal or oral sex. Sexual transmission may be prevented through the use of barrier protection. Perinatal transmission may occur during childbirth and may be prevented by antibiotic treatment of the mother before birth and the application of antibiotic eye gel on the eyes of the newborn. After an episode of gonococcal infection infected persons do not develop immunity to future infections. Reinfection is possible due to N. gonorrhoeae's ability to evade the immune system by varying its surface proteins.N. gonorrhoeae can cause infection of the genitals throat and eyes. Asymptomatic infection is common in males and females. Untreated infection may spread to the rest of the body (disseminated gonorrhea infection) especially the joints (septic arthritis). Untreated infection in women may cause pelvic inflammatory disease and possible infertility due to the resulting scarring. Diagnosis is through culture Gram stain or nucleic acid tests such as polymerase chain reaction of a urine sample urethral swab or cervical swab. Chlamydia co-testing and testing for other STIs is recommended due to high rates of co-infection.Antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae is a growing public health concern especially given its propensity to develop resistance easily."

Kohl's 16-year tenure is the longest of any German chancellor since Otto von Bismarck and oversaw the end of the Cold War the German reunification and the creation of the European Union (EU). Furthermore Kohl's tenure of 16 years 26 days is the longest for any democratically elected chancellor of Germany.Born in Ludwigshafen to a Catholic family Kohl joined the CDU in 1946 at the age of 16. He earned a PhD in history at Heidelberg University in 1958 and worked as a business executive before becoming a full-time politician. He was elected as the youngest member of the Parliament of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1959 and from 1969 to 1976 was minister president of the Rhineland-Palatinate state. Viewed during the 1960s and the early 1970s as a progressive within the CDU he was elected national chairman of the party in 1973. After he had become party leader Kohl was increasingly seen as a more conservative figure. In the 1976 and 1980 federal elections his party performed well but the social-liberal government of social democrat Helmut Schmidt was able to remain in power. After Schmidt had lost the support of the liberal FDP in 1982 Kohl was elected Chancellor through a constructive vote of no confidence forming a coalition government with the FDP. Kohl chaired the G7 in 1985 and 1992.As Chancellor Kohl was committed to European integration and especially to the Franco-German relationship; he was also a steadfast ally of the United States and supported Ronald Reagan's more aggressive policies to weaken the Soviet Union. Following the Revolutions of 1989 his government acted decisively culminating in the German reunification in 1990. Kohl and French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand were the architects of the Maastricht Treaty which established the EU and the Euro currency. Kohl was also a central figure in the eastern enlargement of the EU and his government led the effort to push for international recognition of Croatia Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina when the states declared independence. He played an instrumental role in resolving the Bosnian War. Domestically Kohl's policies from 1990 focused on integrating former East Germany into reunified Germany and he moved the federal capital from the \"provisional capital\" Bonn back to Berlin although he never resided there because the government offices were only relocated in 1999. Kohl also greatly increased federal spending on arts and culture. After his chancellorship Kohl became honorary chairman of the CDU in 1998 but resigned from the position in 2000 in the wake of the CDU donations scandal which damaged his reputation domestically.Kohl received the 1988 Charlemagne Prize and was named Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European Council in 1998. Following his death Kohl was honoured with the first-ever European act of state in Strasbourg. Kohl was described as \"the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century\" by US presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton."

The urinary tract or the intestines may be infected. Symptoms include abdominal pain diarrhea bloody stool or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage kidney failure infertility or bladder cancer. In children it may cause poor growth and learning difficulty.The disease is spread by contact with fresh water contaminated with the parasites. These parasites are released from infected freshwater snails. The disease is especially common among children in developing countries as they are more likely to play in contaminated water. Schistosomiasis is also common among women who can have greater exposure through daily chores that involve water like washing clothes and fetching water. Other high-risk groups include farmers fishermen and people using unclean water during daily living. It belongs to the group of helminth infections. Diagnosis is by finding eggs of the parasite in a person's urine or stool. It can also be confirmed by finding antibodies against the disease in the blood.Methods of preventing the disease include improving access to clean water and reducing the number of snails. In areas where the disease is common the medication praziquantel may be given once a year to the entire group. This is done to decrease the number of people infected and consequently the spread of the disease. Praziquantel is also the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for those who are known to be infected.Schistosomiasis affected about 236.6 million people worldwide in 2019. An estimated 4400 to 200000 people die from it each year. The disease is most commonly found in Africa Asia and South America. Around 700 million people in more than 70 countries live in areas where the disease is common. In tropical countries schistosomiasis is second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with the greatest economic impact. Schistosomiasis is listed as a neglected tropical disease."

However how and when Monodendrio was replaced by the Red Apple Tree and what the latter was based on remains unknown.It is likely relevant to the Turkish legend of the Red Apple (K\u0131z\u0131l Elma) which symbolizes the ultimate goal of conquest. Constantinople was first labelled as the Red Apple followed by Rome Vienna and Moscow.The legend and the term are also used in modern times.

        "article": "The sestertius (pl.: sestertii) or sesterce (pl.: sesterces) was an ancient Roman coin. During the Roman Republic it was a small silver coin issued only on rare occasions. During the Roman Empire it was a large brass coin.The name sestertius means \"two and one half\" referring to its nominal value of two and a half asses (a bronze Roman coin singular as) a value that was useful for commerce because it was one quarter of a denarius a coin worth ten asses.  The name is derived from semis \"half\" and tertius \"third\" in which \"third\" refers to the third as: the sestertius was worth two full asses and half of a third.English-language sources routinely use the original Latin form sestertius plural sestertii; but older literature frequently uses sesterce plural sesterces terce being the English equivalent of tertius.  A modern shorthand for values in sestertii is IIS (Unicode \ud800\udd98) in which the Roman numeral II is followed by S for semis and the whole struck through; but because this symbol and striking through letters are not always convenient HS may be used instead with the horizontal bar of the 'H' representing the strike through the numeral II rather than the letter H."

It is usually a depot injection either subcutaneous or intradermal and not an intramuscular injection. After deposition the drug then diffuses slowly from the depot into the capillary networks where it enters circulation. Skin popping is distinct from intravenous injection in that the latter deposits the drug directly into the bloodstream via a vein. Nonetheless it is included with IV injection in the category of injection drug use because both involve injection both are often done with the same drugs and both carry many of the same risks (such as bloodborne disease risks injection site infection risks and risk of death from overdose). Higher-potency prescription opioids such as morphine fentanyl or meperidine can be injected subcutaneously as can cocaine.  Skin  popping increases the duration of the high one gets from drugs such as cocaine. The sites where skin popping with cocaine has been performed have an area of central pallor surrounded by bruising (ecchymosis). This pattern is due to the vasoconstrictive properties of cocaine acting locally at the injection site with hemorrhage occurring in the surrounding tissue.  Skin popping puts one at risk for developing secondary  amyloid associated (AA) amyloidosis. Tetanus has also been associated with skin-popping as has botulism."

Symptoms may include lethargy loss of weight colonic ulcerations abdominal pain diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding.Cysts of Entamoeba can survive for up to a month in soil or for up to 45 minutes under fingernails. Invasion of the intestinal lining results in bloody diarrhea. If the parasite reaches the bloodstream it can spread through the body most frequently ending up in the liver where it can cause amoebic liver abscesses. Liver abscesses can occur without previous diarrhea. Diagnosis is made by stool examination using microscopy but it can be difficult to distinguish E. hystolitica from other harmless entamoeba species. An increased white blood cell count may be present in severe cases. The most accurate test is finding specific antibodies in the blood but it may remain positive following treatment. Bacterial colitis can result in similar symptoms.Prevention of amoebiasis is by improved sanitation including separating food and water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on the location of the infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole tinidazole nitazoxanide dehydroemetine or chloroquine. Luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. Effective treatment against all stages of the disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms may be treated with just one antibiotic and infections with symptoms are treated with two antibiotics.Amoebiasis is present all over the world though most cases occur in the developing world. About 480 million people are currently infected with about 40 million new cases per year with significant symptoms. This results in the death of between 40000\u2013100000 people a year. The first case of amoebiasis was documented in 1875. In 1891 the disease was described in detail resulting in the terms amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscess. Further evidence from the Philippines in 1913 found that upon swallowing cysts of E. histolytica volunteers developed the disease."

        "article": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner that impairs the normal clearance of mucus from the lungs which facilitates the colonization and infection of the lungs by bacteria notably Staphylococcus aureus. CF is a rare genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs but also the pancreas liver kidneys and intestine. The hallmark feature of CF is the accumulation of thick mucus in different organs. Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections. Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections poor growth fatty stool clubbing of the fingers and toes and infertility in most males. Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.Cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies (alleles) of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly healthy. CFTR is involved in the production of sweat digestive fluids and mucus. When the CFTR is not functional secretions that are usually thin instead become thick. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing. The sweat test measures sodium concentration as people with cystic fibrosis have abnormally salty sweat which can often be tasted by parents kissing their children. Screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world.There is no known cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections are treated with antibiotics which may be given intravenously inhaled or by mouth. Sometimes the antibiotic azithromycin is used long-term. Inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation are important especially in the young. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy may have some short-term benefit but long-term effects are unclear. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world with a median of 40.7 years. Lung problems are responsible for death in 70% of people with cystic fibrosis.CF is most common among people of Northern European ancestry for whom it affects about 1 out of 3000 newborns and among which around 1 out of 25 people is a carrier. It is least common in Africans and Asians though it does occur in all races. It was first recognized as a specific disease by Dorothy Andersen in 1938 with descriptions that fit the condition occurring at least as far back as 1595. The name \"cystic fibrosis\" refers to the characteristic fibrosis and cysts that form within the pancreas."

        "article": "Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm. People may have few or no symptoms for years. In some cases particularly in Asia solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin. After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve. A specific form called neurocysticercosis which affects the brain can cause neurological symptoms. In developing countries this is one of the most common causes of seizures.Cysticercosis is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworms' eggs from human feces. Among foods egg-contaminated vegetables are a major source. The tapeworm eggs are present in the feces of a person infected with the adult worms a condition known as taeniasis. Taeniasis in the strict sense is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork. People who live with someone with the pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis. The diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst. Taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain. An increased number of a type of white blood cell called eosinophils in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator.Infection can be effectively prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation: this includes cooking pork well proper toilets and sanitary practices and improved access to clean water. Treating those with taeniasis is important to prevent spread. Treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required. Treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole. These may be required for long periods. Steroids for anti-inflammation during treatment and anti-seizure medications may also be required. Surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts.The pork tapeworm is particularly common in Asia Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In some areas it is believed that up to 25% of people are affected. In the developed world it is very uncommon. Worldwide in 2015 it caused about 400 deaths. Cysticercosis also affects pigs and cows but rarely causes symptoms as most are slaughtered before symptoms arise. The disease has occurred in humans throughout history. It is one of the neglected tropical diseases."

Less common forms include polycystic echinococcosis and unicystic echinococcosis.The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst's location and size. Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected the patient may experience abdominal pain weight loss along with yellow-toned skin discoloration from developed jaundice. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest shortness of breath and coughing.The infection is spread when food or water that contains the eggs of the parasite is ingested or by close contact with an infected animal. The eggs are released in the stool of meat-eating animals that are infected by the parasite. Commonly infected animals include dogs foxes and wolves. For these animals to become infected they must eat the organs of an animal that contains the cysts such as sheep or rodents. The type of disease that occurs in human patients depends on the type of Echinococcus causing the infection. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasound though computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. Blood tests looking for antibodies against the parasite may be helpful as may biopsy.Prevention of cystic disease is by treating dogs that may carry the disease and vaccination of sheep. Treatment is often difficult. The cystic disease may be drained through the skin followed by medication. Sometimes this type of disease is just watched. The alveolar form often requires surgical intervention followed by medications. The medication used is albendazole which may be needed for years. The alveolar disease may result in death.The disease occurs in most areas of the world and currently affects about one million people. In some areas of South America Africa and Asia up to 10% of the certain populations are affected. In 2015 the cystic form caused about 1200 deaths; down from 2000 in 1990. The economic cost of the disease is estimated to be around US$3 billion a year. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and belongs to the group of diseases known as helminthiases (worm infections). It can affect other animals such as pigs cows and horses.Terminology used in this field is crucial since echinococcosis requires the involvement of specialists from nearly all disciplines. In 2020 an international effort of scientists from 16 countries led to a detailed consensus on terms to be used or rejected for the genetics epidemiology biology immunology and clinical aspects of echinococcosis."

People who develop mycetoma likely have a weakened immune system. It can take between 3 months to 50 years from time of infection to first seeking healthcare advice.Diagnosis requires ultrasound and fine needle aspiration.While most cases of mycetoma occur in Sudan Venezuela Mexico and India its true prevalence and incidence are not well-known. It appears most frequently in people living in rural areas particularly in farmers and shepherds who are often men between 20 and 40 years earning the primary incomes for their families. It has been reported since 1840. Noteworthy the diagnosis of mycetoma in non-endemic or low endemic areas as Europe and North Africa is challenging. Physicians in these areas are usually unfamiliar with the disease-specific manifestations and need to exercise extra vigilance regarding those patients who are at high risk of contracting mycetoma infections. Recent evidence suggests that Egypt which borders sub-Saharan Africa is a low-endemic country. Additionally recent evidence suggests that Pakistan which borders India is a moderate-endemic country. Unlike bacterial acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and septic arthritis misdiagnosed or delayed diagnosis of mycetoma osteomyelitis can result in amputation or radical resection.

As with the other Actinomycetota streptomycetes are gram-positive  and have very large genomes with high GC content.  Found predominantly in soil and decaying vegetation most streptomycetes produce spores and are noted for their distinct \"earthy\" odor that results from production of a volatile metabolite geosmin. Different strains of the same species may colonize very diverse environments.Streptomycetes are characterised by a complex secondary metabolism. Between 5-23% (average: 12%) of the protein-coding genes of each Streptomyces species are implicated in secondary metabolism. Streptomycetes produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin (e.g. neomycin streptomycin cypemycin grisemycin bottromycins and chloramphenicol). The antibiotic streptomycin takes its name directly from Streptomyces. Streptomycetes are infrequent pathogens though infections in humans such as mycetoma can be caused by S. somaliensis and S. sudanensis and in plants can be caused by S. caviscabies S. acidiscabies S. turgidiscabies and S. scabies."

Mitral stenosis can also lead to pulmonary hemosiderosis.Hemosiderin collects throughout the body in hemochromatosis.Hemosiderin deposition in the liver is a common feature of hemochromatosis and is the cause of liver failure in the disease.Selective iron deposition in the beta cells of pancreatic islets leads to diabetes due to distribution of transferrin receptor on the beta cells of islets and in the skin leads to hyperpigmentation.Hemosiderin deposition in the brain is seen after bleeds from any source including chronic subdural hemorrhage cerebral arteriovenous malformations cavernous hemangiomata. Hemosiderin depositionon on the surface of the brain and spinal cord due to chronic bleeding in the subarachnoid space is known as superficial siderosis.Hemosiderin collects in the skin and is slowly removed after bruising; hemosiderin may remain in some conditions such as stasis dermatitis.Hemosiderin in the kidneys has been associated with marked hemolysis and a rare blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.Hemosiderin may deposit in diseases associated with iron overload. These diseases are typically diseases in which chronic blood loss requires frequent blood transfusions such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia though beta thalassemia minor has been associated with hemosiderin deposits in the liver in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease independent of any transfusions.Iron overload occurs when iron intake is increased over a sustained period of time due to regular transfusion of whole blood and red cells or because of increased absorption of iron through the gastrointestinal tract (GI).Both these phenomena occur in thalassaemias with blood transfusion therapy being the major cause of iron overload in thalassaemia major and increased GI absorption being more important in patients with intermedia thalassaemia who are not frequently transfused.Each unit of blood contains about 200\u00a0mg iron. After 50 units have been transfused or earlier in children siderosis develops with increased pigmentation of skin exposed to light and susceptibility to infection reduced growth and delayed sexual development and puberty(24). The recommended red cell transfusion scheme for patients with \u03b2-thalassaemia amounts to 116\u2013232\u00a0mg iron per Kg weight on an annual basis (0.32-0.64\u00a0mg/Kg/day).The human body lacks a mechanism to excrete excess iron. Iron accumulation is toxic to many tissues causing heart failure cirrhosis liver cancer growth retardation and endocrine abnormalities. In the absence of regular iron chelation therapy the iron loading rates vary. Monitoring of transfusion iron overload is essential for effective and safe iron chelation tailored to the individual's specific needs.Serum ferritin (SF) measured at least every 3 months (the currently accepted target value is between 500 and 1000\u00a0mg/L) should also be evaluated along with the liver iron concentration (LIC) assessed using a validated and standardized MRI technique and myocardial iron as measured by MRI-based methods with specific software T2*.For monitoring of transfusion iron overload other organ function and iron-mediated damage surveillance of the patient for diabetes hypothyroidism hypoparathyroidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is recommended."

        "article": "Graves' disease also known as toxic diffuse goiter is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid. It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It also often results in an enlarged thyroid. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability muscle weakness sleeping problems a fast heartbeat poor tolerance of heat diarrhea and unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins known as pretibial myxedema and eye bulging a condition caused by Graves' ophthalmopathy. About 25 to 30% of people with the condition develop eye problems.The exact cause of the disease is unclear but symptoms are a result of antibodies binding to receptors on the thyroid causing over-expression of thyroid hormone. Persons are more likely to be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one twin is affected a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease. The onset of disease may be triggered by physical or emotional stress infection or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that has a similar effect to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and radioiodine uptake. Typically blood tests show a raised T3 and T4 low TSH increased radioiodine uptake in all areas of the thyroid and TSI antibodies.The three treatment options are radioiodine therapy medications and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth which is then concentrated in the thyroid and destroys it over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers may control some of the symptoms and antithyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people while other treatments are having effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. Eye problems may require additional treatments.Graves' disease develops in about 0.5% of males and 3.0% of females. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men. Often it starts between the ages of 40 and 60 but can begin at any age. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases). The condition is named after Irish surgeon Robert Graves who described it in 1835. A number of prior descriptions also exist."

It occurs most commonly in individuals with Graves' disease and less commonly in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis or in those who are euthyroid.It is part of a systemic process with variable expression in the eyes thyroid and skin caused by autoantibodies that bind to tissues in those organs. The autoantibodies target the fibroblasts in the eye muscles and those fibroblasts can differentiate into fat cells (adipocytes). Fat cells and muscles expand and become inflamed. Veins become compressed and are unable to drain fluid causing edema.Annual incidence is 16/100000 in women 3/100000 in men. About 3\u20135% have severe disease with intense pain and sight-threatening corneal ulceration or compression of the optic nerve. Cigarette smoking which is associated with many autoimmune diseases raises the incidence 7.7-fold.Mild disease will often resolve and merely requires measures to reduce discomfort and dryness such as artificial tears and smoking cessation if possible. Severe cases are a medical emergency and are treated with glucocorticoids (steroids) and sometimes ciclosporin. Many anti-inflammatory biological mediators such as infliximab etanercept and anakinra are being tried.

Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism. Some however use the terms interchangeably. Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability muscle weakness sleeping problems a fast heartbeat heat intolerance diarrhea enlargement of the thyroid hand tremor and weight loss. Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy. An uncommon but life-threatening complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature; this often results in death. The opposite is hypothyroidism when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.Graves' disease is the cause of about 50% to 80% of the cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Other causes include multinodular goiter toxic adenoma inflammation of the thyroid eating too much iodine and too much synthetic thyroid hormone. A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests. Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and raised T3 or T4. Radioiodine uptake by the thyroid thyroid scan and measurement of antithyroid autoantibodies (thyroidal thyrotropin receptor antibodies are positive in Graves disease)  may help determine the cause.Treatment depends partly on the cause and severity of disease. There are three main treatment options: radioiodine therapy medications and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth which is then concentrated in and destroys the thyroid over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone. Medications such as beta blockers may control the symptoms and anti-thyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people while other treatments are having an effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. This may be used in those with very large thyroids or when cancer is a concern. In the United States hyperthyroidism affects about 1.2% of the population. Worldwide hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults. It occurs between two and ten times more often in women. Onset is commonly between 20 and 50 years of age. Overall the disease is more common in those over the age of 60 years."

These clinical manifestations can involve virtually every system in the body. The mechanisms that mediate these effects are not well understood. The severity of the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism is related to the duration of the disease the magnitude of the thyroid hormone excess and the patient's age. Although the majority of patients experience significant improvement and remission after proper medical care health care providers should be aware of variability in individual response to hyperthyroidism and individual sensitivity to thyroid hormone fluctuations. Patients with Graves' disease can also undergo periods of hypothyroidism (inadequate production of thyroid hormone; see symptoms of hypothyroidism) due to the challenges of finding the right dosage of thyroid hormone suppression and/or supplementation. The body's need for thyroid hormone can also change over time such as in the first months after radioactive iodine treatment (RAI). Thyroid autoimmune diseases can also be volatile as hyperthyroidism can interchange with hypothyroidism and euthyroidism."

        "article": "Isotopic labeling (or isotopic labelling) is a technique used to track the passage of an isotope (an atom with a detectable variation in neutron count) through chemical reaction metabolic pathway or a biological cell. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing one or more specific atoms with their isotopes. The reactant is then allowed to undergo the reaction. The position of the isotopes in the products is measured to determine what sequence the isotopic atom followed in the reaction or the cell's metabolic pathway. The nuclides used in isotopic labeling may be stable nuclides or radionuclides. In the latter case the labeling is called radiolabeling.In isotopic labeling there are multiple ways to detect the presence of labeling isotopes; through their mass vibrational mode or radioactive decay. Mass spectrometry detects the difference in an isotope's mass while infrared spectroscopy detects the difference in the isotope's vibrational modes. Nuclear magnetic resonance detects atoms with different gyromagnetic ratios. The radioactive decay can be detected through an ionization chamber or autoradiographs of gels.An example of the use of isotopic labeling is the study of phenol (C6H5OH) in water by replacing common hydrogen (protium) with deuterium (deuterium labeling). Upon adding phenol to deuterated water (water containing D2O in addition to the usual H2O) the substitution of deuterium for the hydrogen is observed in phenol's hydroxyl group (resulting in C6H5OD) indicating that phenol readily undergoes hydrogen-exchange reactions with water. Only the hydroxyl group is affected indicating that the other 5 hydrogen atoms do not participate in the exchange reactions."

Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping.  All machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine. Thus the relative movement between the workpiece and the cutting tool (which is called the toolpath) is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent rather than being entirely \"offhand\" or \"freehand\". It is a power-driven metal cutting machine which assists in managing the needed relative motion between cutting tool and the job that changes the size and shape of the job material.The precise definition of the term machine tool varies among users as discussed below. While all machine tools are \"machines that help people to make things\" not all factory machines are machine tools.Today machine tools are typically powered other than by the  human muscle (e.g. electrically hydraulically or via line shaft) used to make manufactured parts (components) in various ways that include cutting or certain other kinds of deformation.With their inherent precision machine tools enabled the economical production of interchangeable parts."

It is one of the most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances.Milling can be done with a wide range of machine tools. The original class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC) in the 1960s milling machines evolved into machining centers: milling machines augmented by automatic tool changers tool magazines or carousels CNC capability coolant systems and enclosures. Milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) or horizontal machining centers (HMCs).The integration of milling into turning environments and vice versa began with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations. This led to a new class of machine tools multitasking machines (MTMs) which are purpose-built to facilitate milling and turning within the same work envelope."

        "article": "Undertow is the debut studio album by the American rock band Tool released on April 6 1993 by Zoo Entertainment. Produced by the band and Sylvia Massy it was recorded from October to December 1992 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys and Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood. The album includes some tracks the band decided to not release on their debut EP Opiate. This is their only album to feature original bassist Paul D'Amour.According to AllMusic Undertow helped heavy metal remain prominent as a mainstream musical style and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. It was released at a time when grunge was at the height of its popularity and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. AllMusic saw the album's success in the \"striking haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.\"As of 2020 Undertow has sold over three million copies in the United States and is certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America."

        "article": "Nintendo thumb also known as gamer's thumb and similar names is a form of repetitive strain injury (RSI) caused by excessive playing of video games with the traditional Nintendo controller. This injury mainly occurs due to repeated thumb movements while playing video games. The symptoms can include blistering paraesthesia (a tingling or a burning feeling in the skin) as well as swelling of the thumbs though any finger can be affected. This can lead to stress on tendons nerves and ligaments in the hands and further onto lateral epicondylitis (\"tennis elbow\") tendinitis (severe swelling of the tendon) bursitis (inflammation of the fluid-filled sac around joints) and carpal tunnel syndrome (compression of the median nerve at the wrist). Similar injuries can occur with other gaming systems such as PlayStation thumb from playing Sony PlayStation. The general recommendation for the treatment is to rest and stop the repetitive motion of the affected finger (usually the thumb). In more severe and painful cases using NSAIDs is also recommended.Other less localized injuries in the shoulder knee and Achilles tendon have also been noted to arise from playing the Nintendo Wii. Some of the symptoms can be associated with the De Quervain syndrome (degeneration of tendons that control the movement of the thumb)."

Abrasions usually involve minimal bleeding.   Mild abrasions also known as grazes or scrapes do not scar or bleed because the dermis is left intact but deep abrasions that disrupt the normal dermal structures may lead to the formation of scar tissue. A more traumatic abrasion that removes all layers of skin is called an avulsion.Abrasion injuries most commonly occur when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface causing a grinding or rubbing away of the upper layers of the epidermis."

        "article": "An abrasion collar also known as an abrasion ring or abrasion rim is a narrow ring of stretched abraded skin immediately surrounding projectile wounds such as gunshot wounds. It is most commonly associated with entrance wounds and is a mechanical defect due to a projectile's penetration through the skin. It is caused by a temporary over-stretching of the skin surrounding the projectile's point of penetration. Like all skin abrasions the abrasion collar tends to dry out due to scraping away of the skin's outer layers and the collapse and dehydration of the underlying cells; it therefore becomes easier to discern with time. This defect is most often seen around rifled firearm entrance wounds due to the striations or grooves in the bullet's surface caused by the rifling on the inside of the weapon's barrel; however certain other high-velocity projectile wounds can also have the same effect.An abrasion collar is usually found in association with a contusion collar of bruising caused by damaged blood vessels in the skin by hydrostatic forces from the bullet's entry. An abrasion rim defect is also possible in firearm exit wounds under certain circumstances such as if the skin at the exit was crushed between the outgoing bullet and an unyielding object pressed against the skin over the exit site or if the projectile exits at an extreme angle. Careful examination of the wound under magnification may show signs of everted (outward-turned) edges characteristic of an exit wound. Multiple projectiles impacting in close proximity together such as in a close-range shotgun blast will usually still produce an abrasion rim or artefact though the wound will likely be irregular in shape."

Most people recover completely within three days.Most cases are due to minor trauma to the eye such as that which can occur with contact lens use or from fingernails. About 25% of cases occur at work. Diagnosis is often by slit lamp examination after fluorescein dye has been applied. More significant injuries like a corneal ulcer globe rupture recurrent erosion syndrome and a foreign body within the eye should be ruled out.Prevention includes the use of eye protection. Treatment is typically with antibiotic ointment. In those who wear contact lenses a fluoroquinolone antibiotic is often recommended. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) NSAIDs and eye drops such as cyclopentolate that paralyse the pupil can help with pain. Evidence does not support the usefulness of eye patching for those with simple abrasions.About 3 per 1000 people are affected a year in the United States. Males are more often affected than females. The typical age group affected is those in their 20s and 30s. Complications can include bacterial keratitis corneal ulcer and iritis. Complications may occur in up to 10% of people."

Defensive wounds are often found on the hands and forearms if a victim raised them to protect the head and face or to fend off an assault but may also be present on the feet and legs if a victim attempted defense while lying down and kicking out at an assailant.The appearance and nature of the wound varies with the type of weapon used and the location of the injury and may present as a laceration abrasion contusion or bone fracture. Where a victim has time to raise hands or arms before being shot by an assailant the injury may also present as a gunshot wound. Severe laceration of the palmar surface of the hand or partial amputation of fingers may result from the victim grasping the blade of a weapon during an attack. In forensic pathology the presence of defense wounds is highly indicative of homicide and also proves that the victim was at least initially conscious and able to offer some resistance during the attack.Defense wounds may be classified as active or passive. A victim of a knife attack for example would receive active defense wounds from grasping at the knife's blade and passive defense wounds on the back of the hand if it was raised up to protect the face."

Frequent use is not recommended in people with thyroid problems or who are taking lithium.Povidone-iodine is a chemical complex of povidone hydrogen iodide and elemental iodine. The recommended strength solution contains 10% Povidone with total iodine species equaling 10000 ppm or 1% total titratable iodine. It works by releasing iodine which results in the death of a range of microorganisms.Povidone-iodine came into commercial use in 1955.

        "article": "A string is the vibrating element of chordophones such as the guitar harp piano (piano wire) and the violin family that produces sound. Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a musical instrument holds under tension so that they can vibrate freely but with control. This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility to play in action.There are two main kinds of strings; plain and wound. \"Plain\" strings are simply one piece of cylindrical material commonly consisted of nylon or gut while \"wound\" strings have a central core plus other material which is tightly wound around the string (usually made of various metals).Prior to World War II strings of many instruments (including violins and guitars) were composed of a material known as catgut a type of cord made from refined natural fibers of animal intestines. This was the status quo until the 1950s when mainstream popularity fell for gut strings and steel and nylon strings became more favored in string making. Although catgut is still prized by many musicians today due to its unique sound. The invention of wound strings (particularly steel) was a crucial step in string instrument technology because a metal-wound string can produce a lower pitch than a plain gut string of similar thickness. This enabled stringed instruments to be made with thinner bass strings.On string instruments that the player plucks or bows directly (e.g. double bass) this enabled instrument makers to use thinner strings for the lowest-pitched strings which made the lower-pitch strings easier to play. On stringed instruments in which the player presses a keyboard causing a mechanism to strike the strings such as a piano this enabled piano builders to use shorter thicker strings to produce the lowest-pitched bass notes enabling the building of smaller upright pianos designed for small rooms and practice rooms."

It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases. Types include stable angina unstable angina and myocardial infarction.A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder arm back neck or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress last less than a few minutes and improve with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. In many cases the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat.Risk factors include high blood pressure smoking diabetes lack of exercise obesity high blood cholesterol poor diet depression and excessive alcohol consumption. A number of tests may help with diagnoses including: electrocardiogram cardiac stress testing coronary computed tomographic angiography biomarkers (high-sensitivity cardiac troponins) and coronary angiogram among others.Ways to reduce CAD risk include eating a healthy diet regularly exercising maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking. Medications for diabetes high cholesterol or high blood pressure are sometimes used. There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms. Treatment involves the same measures as prevention. Additional medications such as antiplatelets (including aspirin) beta blockers or nitroglycerin may be recommended. Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be used in severe disease. In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improves life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk.In 2015 CAD affected 110 million people and resulted in 8.9 million deaths. It makes up 15.6% of all deaths making it the most common cause of death globally. The risk of death from CAD for a given age decreased between 1980 and 2010 especially in developed countries. The number of cases of CAD for a given age also decreased between 1990 and 2010. In the United States in 2010 about 20% of those over 65 had CAD while it was present in 7% of those 45 to 64 and 1.3% of those 18 to 45; rates were higher among males than females of a given age."

Parkinson's disease dementia falls and neuropsychiatric problems such as sleep abnormalities psychosis mood swings or behavioral changes may arise in advanced stages.Most of the cases of Parkinson's disease are sporadic and a few contributing factors have been identified. Pathophysiology is characterized by nerve cell death in the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra latter being a midbrain region that supplies dopamine to the basal ganglia which are involved in voluntary motor control. The cause of this cell death is poorly understood but includes the alpha-synuclein aggregation into Lewy bodies within the neurons. Other possible factors involve genetic and environmental mechanisms as well as medications lifestyle or previous conditions.Diagnosis is mainly based on signs and symptoms usually motor-related found via neurological examination though medical imaging like neuromelanin MRI can support the diagnosis. Usual onset is in people over 60 years of age of whom about one percent are affected. In those younger than 50 it is termed early-onset PD.No cure is known and treatment aims to mitigate symptoms. Initial treatment typically includes L-DOPA MAO-B inhibitors or dopamine agonists. As the disease progresses these medications become less effective and produce a side effect marked by involuntary muscle movements. Diet and certain forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce severe motor symptoms where drugs are ineffective. There is little evidence for treatment of the non-movement-related symptoms such as sleep disturbances and mood instability. The average life expectancy is near-normal."

        "article": "Fracture blisters occur on skin overlying a fractured bone and fractures complicated by the development of overlying blisters remain a clinical dilemma in orthopedics.:\u200a43\u200aFracture blisters are tense vesicles or bullae that arise on markedly swollen skin directly overlying a fracture. Fracture blisters pop up in trauma patients but are relatively rare and only occur in 2.9% of patients with a fracture requiring hospitalization. A fracture blister typically occurs near fractures where the skin has little subcutaneous tissue between it and bone. These include elbows knees ankles and wrists. They tend to complicate fracture management because they interfere with splinting casting and incision planning for open reduction procedures. They can appear anytime within the first 6-8 hours following an injury and most appear within the first 24-48 hours.At the location of the fracture there is an increase in compartment pressure that is found around the area in limbs where blisters do not form and a fasciotomy is not performed versus in those where the blisters are found. It is presumed that the formation of the blisters relieves some of the myofascial pressure..  It can be noted  that there is a decreased number of tight junctions and activation of the paracellular pathway in the blistered skin allowing for fluid passage into the blister.These blisters are thought to be caused by  shearing forces applied at the time of injury. When the bones are broken and deform from their normal shape the attached skin is then strained to a predictable degree which can be calculated using a formula that takes into account the angle of deformation and the start and end lengths of the area of skin being measured.  The shearing and subsequent strain is a result of the difference in elasticity between the dermis and epidermis. There are two types clear fluid and hemorrhagic and the difference is found in the level of the shear. Clear fluid blisters separate layers within the epidermis and hemorrhagic blisters separate at the dermal-epidermal junction. It was found that a strain of 152% generated enough force to shear the skin layers and cause the formation of a hemorrhagic blister. Hemorrhagic blisters are more serious as they represent a complete stripping of epidermal cells. Clinically the type of blister determines the healing time; clear blisters take about 12 days and hemorrhagic blisters heal in about 16 days. Risk factors that predispose a patient to formation of a blister include but are not limited to: anatomical sites with thin and tightly adhered overlying skin peripheral vascular disease collagen vascular disease hypertension smoking alcoholism diabetes mellitus lymphatic obstruction high energy injuries and grade I and II open tibia fractures. Repair of the fracture prior to the formation of a blister is most ideal option. However if that cannot be done decision to pop the blisters in order to treat the fracture or wait for them to heal first usually hinges on the preferences of the orthopaedic surgeon as there is a lack of data on what treatment is ideal. Waiting delays care an average of 7 days and longer for tibial plateau and calcaneal fractures. Operating immediately anecdotally increases wound infection rates."

Sucking blisters are due to natural neonatal sucking reflexes on the affected areas in utero. These sucking blisters become present at birth when the sucking movements are very aggressive while in the uterus. These blisters are commonly found on the newborn's arms fingers or any body part they are able to suck on. It is a very rare condition seen in less than 1% of newborns. It is difficult to diagnose because its appearance can be mistaken as other skin conditions. Diagnosis is usually done by eliminating other possible cutaneous conditions. This process of elimination includes examining blood culture lesions and inflammatory markers. This skin condition is usually self-inflicted benign and can heal on its own. Sucking blisters do typically not require medical treatment and disappear within a week."

Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. About 90\u201395% of cases are primary defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet excess body weight smoking physical inactivity and alcohol use. The remaining 5\u201310% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure defined as high blood pressure due to a clearly identifiable cause such as chronic kidney disease narrowing of the kidney arteries an endocrine disorder or the use of birth control pills.Blood pressure is classified by two measurements the systolic (high reading) and diastolic (lower reading) pressures. For most adults normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100\u2013130 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60\u201380 mmHg diastolic. For most adults high blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/80 or 140/90 mmHg. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office-based blood pressure measurement. Hypertension is around twice as common in diabetics.Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications. Lifestyle changes include weight loss physical exercise decreased salt intake reducing alcohol intake and a healthy diet. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used. Up to three medications taken concurrently can control blood pressure in 90% of people. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as &gt;160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy. The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 130/80\u00a0mmHg and 160/100\u00a0mmHg is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others finding unclear benefit. High blood pressure affects between 16 and 37% of the population globally. In 2010 hypertension was believed to have been a factor in 17.8% of all deaths (9.4 million globally)."

Many studies have been performed around the world to estimate the numbers of individuals infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 by determining if they have developed antibodies against either viral species.This information provides population prevalence of HSV viral infections in individuals with or without active disease.

According to a 2006 estimate 57% of American adults were infected with HSV-1 which is spread through droplets casual contact and sometimes sexual contact though most infected people never have cold sores. The rest of cases are due to HSV-2 which is typically spread through sexual contact and is the cause of genital herpes.Two-thirds of HSE cases occur in individuals already seropositive for HSV-1 few of whom (only 10%) have history of recurrent orofacial herpes while about one third of cases results from an initial infection by HSV-1 predominantly occurring in individuals under the age of 18. Approximately half of individuals who develop HSE are over 50 years of age. The most common cause for encephalitis in children and adults is HSV-1.

        "article": "Herpetic simplex keratitis is a form of keratitis caused by recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in the cornea.It begins with infection of epithelial cells on the surface of the eye and retrograde infection of nerves serving the cornea. Primary infection typically presents as swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids (blepharoconjunctivitis) accompanied by small white itchy lesions on the corneal surface. The effect of the lesions varies from minor damage to the epithelium (superficial punctate keratitis) to more serious consequences such as the formation of dendritic ulcers. Infection is unilateral affecting one eye at a time.  Additional symptoms include dull pain deep inside the eye mild to acute dryness and sinusitis. Most primary infections resolve spontaneously in a few weeks.  Healing can be aided by the use of oral and topical antivirals.Subsequent recurrences may be more severe with infected epithelial cells showing larger dendritic ulceration and lesions forming white plaques. The epithelial layer is sloughed off as the dendritic ulcer grows and mild inflammation (iritis) may occur in the underlying stroma of iris. Sensation loss occurs in lesional areas producing generalised corneal anaesthesia with repeated recurrences. Recurrence can be accompanied by chronic dry eye low grade intermittent conjunctivitis or chronic unexplained sinusitis. Following persistent infection  the concentration of viral DNA reaches a critical limit. Antibody responses against the viral antigen expression in the stroma can trigger a massive immune response in the eye.  The response may result in the destruction of the corneal stroma resulting in loss of vision due to opacification of the cornea. This is known as immune-mediated stromal keratitis.HSV infection is very common in humans. It has been estimated that one third of the world population have recurrent infection. Keratitis caused by HSV is the most common cause of cornea-derived blindness in developed nations. Therefore HSV infections are a large and worldwide public health problem. The global incidence (rate of new disease) of herpes keratitis is roughly 1.5 million including 40000 new cases of severe monocular visual impairment or blindness each year."

        "article": "A cystic hygroma is an abnormal growth that usually appears on a baby's neck or head. It consists of one or more cysts and tends to grow larger over time. The disorder usually develops while the fetus is still in the uterus but can also appear after birth.Also known as cystic lymphangioma and macrocystic lymphatic malformation the growth is often a congenital lymphatic lesion of many small cavities (multiloculated) that can arise anywhere but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck and armpits. The malformation contains large cyst-like cavities containing lymph a watery fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system. Microscopically cystic hygroma consists of multiple locules filled with lymph. Deep locules are quite big but they decrease in size towards the surface.Cystic hygromas are benign but can be disfiguring. It is a condition which usually affects children; very rarely it can be present in adulthood.Currently the medical field prefers to use the term lymphatic malformation because the term cystic hygroma means water tumor. Lymphatic malformation is more commonly used now because it is a sponge-like collection of abnormal growth that contains clear lymphatic fluid. The fluid collects within the cysts or channels usually in the soft tissue. Cystic hygromas occur when the lymphatic vessels that make up the lymphatic system are not formed properly. The two types of lymphatic malformations are macrocystic  (large cysts) and microcystic (small cysts) lymphatic malformations. A person may have only one kind of the malformation or can have a mixture of both macro- and microcysts.Cystic hygroma can be associated with a nuchal lymphangioma or a fetal hydrops. Additionally it can be associated with Down syndrome Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome. If it is diagnosed in the third trimester then chances of association with Down syndrome are increased but if diagnosed in the second trimester then it is associated with Turner syndrome.A lethal version of this condition exists known as Cowchock\u2013Wapner\u2013Kurtz syndrome that in addition to cystic hygroma includes cleft palate and lymphedema a condition of localized edema and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system."

The lymphatic system is the network of vessels responsible for returning to the venous system excess fluid from tissues as well as the lymph nodes that filter this fluid for signs of pathogens. These malformations can occur at any age and may involve any part of the body but 90% occur in children less than 2 years of age and involve the head and neck. These malformations are either congenital or acquired. Congenital lymphangiomas are often associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner syndrome although they can also exist in isolation. Lymphangiomas are commonly diagnosed before birth using fetal ultrasonography. Acquired lymphangiomas may result from trauma inflammation or lymphatic obstruction.Most lymphangiomas are benign lesions that result only in a soft slow-growing \"doughy\" mass. Since they have no chance of becoming malignant lymphangiomas are usually treated for cosmetic reasons only. Rarely impingement upon critical organs may result in complications such as respiratory distress when a lymphangioma compresses the airway. Treatment includes aspiration surgical excision laser and radiofrequency ablation and sclerotherapy."

Its large leaves have three to five deep lobes. Its fruit (referred to as syconium a type of multiple fruit) is tear-shaped 3\u20135\u00a0cm (1\u20132\u00a0in) long with a green skin that may ripen toward purple or brown and sweet soft reddish flesh containing numerous crunchy seeds. The milky sap of the green parts is an irritant to human skin. In the Northern Hemisphere fresh figs are in season from late summer to early autumn. They tolerate moderate seasonal frost and can be grown even in hot-summer continental climates.Figs can be eaten fresh or dried or processed into jam rolls biscuits and other types of desserts. Since ripe fruit does not transport and keep well most commercial production is in dried and processed forms. Raw figs contain roughly 80% water and 20% carbohydrates with negligible protein fat and micronutrient content. They are a moderate source of dietary fiber.In 2018 world production of raw figs was 1.14 million tonnes led by Turkey and North African countries (Egypt Morocco and Algeria) as the largest producers collectively accounting for 64% of the total."

It is an often painful condition in which the nail grows so that it cuts into one or both sides of the paronychium or nail bed. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet they occur most commonly with the toenails (as opposed to fingernails) and for the most part are only problematic and painful on the big toe.A common conception is that the nail enters into the paronychium but an \"ingrown toenail\" can simply be overgrown toe skin. The condition starts first from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium and then a granuloma which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. A true ingrown toenail is caused by actual penetration of flesh by a sliver of toenail."

The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a mechanical process where hair and skin debris get sucked into the subcutaneous tissues through skin openings called pits.  Diagnosis is based on symptoms and examination.If there is infection treatment is generally by incision and drainage just off the midline. Shaving the area and laser hair removal may prevent recurrence. More extensive surgery may be required if the disease recurs. Antibiotics are usually not needed. Without treatment the condition may remain long term.About 3 per 10000 people per year are affected and it occurs more often in males than females. Young adults are most commonly affected.

        "article": "A cyst is a pathological epithelial lined cavity that fills with fluid or soft material and usually grows from internal pressure generated by fluid being drawn into the cavity from osmosis (hydrostatic pressure). The bones of the jaws the mandible and maxilla are the bones with the highest prevalence of cysts in the human body. This is due to the abundant amount of epithelial remnants that can be left in the bones of the jaws.  The enamel of teeth is formed from ectoderm (the precursor germ layer to skin and mucosa) and so remnants of epithelium can be left in the bone during odontogenesis (tooth development). The bones of the jaws develop from embryologic processes which fuse and ectodermal tissue may be trapped along the lines of this fusion. This \"resting\" epithelium (also termed cell rests) is usually dormant or undergoes atrophy but when stimulated may form a cyst. The reasons why resting epithelium may proliferate and undergo cystic transformation are generally unknown but inflammation is thought to be a major factor. The high prevalence of tooth impactions and dental infections that occur in the bones of the jaws is also significant to explain why cysts are more common at these sites.Cysts that arise from tissue(s) that would normally develop into teeth are referred to as odontogenic cysts. Other cysts of the jaws are termed non-odontogenic cysts. Non-odontogenic cysts form from tissues other than those involved in tooth development and consequently may contain structures such as epithelium from the nose. As the cyst grows from hydraulic pressure it causes the bone around it to resorb and may cause movement of teeth or other vital structures such as nerves and blood vessels or resorb the roots of teeth. Most cysts do not cause any symptoms and are discovered on routine dental radiographs. Some cysts may not require any treatment but if treatment is required it usually involves some minor surgery to partially or completely remove the cyst in a one or two-stage procedure."

        "article": "The third molar commonly called wisdom tooth is the most posterior of the three molars in each quadrant of the human dentition. The age at which wisdom teeth come through (erupt) is variable but this generally occurs between late teens and early twenties. Most adults have four wisdom teeth one in each of the four quadrants but it is possible to have none fewer or more in which case the extras are called supernumerary teeth. Wisdom teeth may become stuck (impacted) against other teeth if there is not enough space for them to come through normally. Impacted wisdom teeth are still sometimes removed for orthodontic treatment believing that they move the other teeth and cause crowding though this is not held anymore as true. Impacted wisdom teeth may suffer from tooth decay if oral hygiene becomes more difficult. Wisdom teeth which are partially erupted through the gum may also cause inflammation and infection in the surrounding gum tissues termed pericoronitis. More conservative treatments such as operculectomies may be appropriate for some cases. However impacted wisdom teeth are commonly extracted to treat or prevent these problems. Some sources oppose the prophylactic removal of disease-free impacted wisdom teeth including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK."

        "article": "Millipedes (originating from the Latin mille \"thousand\" and pes \"foot\") are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda the name derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\" no species was known to have 1000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of Eumillipes persephone which can have over 1300 legs. There are approximately 12000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter; however some eat fungi or drink plant fluid. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans although some can become household or garden pests. Millipedes can be an unwanted nuisance particularly in greenhouses where they can potentially cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves with a variety of chemicals secreted from pores along the body although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Its primary defence mechanism is to curl into a tight coil thereby protecting its legs and other vital delicate areas on the body behind a hard exoskeleton. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods which transfer packets of sperm to females.First appearing in the Silurian period millipedes are some of the oldest known land animals. Some members of prehistoric groups such as Arthropleura grew to over 2\u00a0m (6+1\u20442\u00a0ft); the largest modern species reach maximum lengths of 27 to 38\u00a0cm (10+1\u20442 to 15\u00a0in). The longest extant species is the giant African millipede (Archispirostreptus gigas).Among myriapods millipedes have traditionally been considered most closely related to the tiny pauropods although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda) which move rapidly are venomous carnivorous and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist."
